00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:12,140
The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint exupery Audiobook edition 20 2020 by David De de Angelis All rights reserved

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,100
Narrated by Stephanie Richardson

3
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,460
To Leon Wirth

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:27,100
I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grownup

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,920
I have a serious reason

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:34,030
He is the best friend I have in the world

7
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,200
I have another reason this grown-up understands everything

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,510
even books about children

9
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,810
I have a third reason he lives in France

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,010
where he is hungry and cold

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,040
He needs cheering up

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,000
If all these reasons are not enough

13
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,180
I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew

14
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,440
All grown-ups were once children

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,570
although few of them remember it

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:10,980
and so I correct my dedication to Leon Worth when he was a little boy

17
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,440
One

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,880
once when I was six years old

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:28,450
I saw a magnificent picture in a book called True Stories from Nature about the primeval forest

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:33,650
It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal

21
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,260
Here is a copy of the drawing in the book

22
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:44,160
It said boa constrictor swallow their prey whole without chewing it

23
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,450
After that

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,160
they are not able to move and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,840
I pondered deeply then over the adventures of the jungle

26
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,950
and after some work with a colored pencil

27
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,680
I succeeded in making my first drawing

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,780
my drawing number one

29
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,620
it looked something like this

30
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,640
I showed my masterpiece to the grownups and asked them whether the drawing frightened them

31
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,640
but they answered frighten

32
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,970
Why should anyone be frightened by a hat

33
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,540
My drawing was not a picture of a hat

34
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,120
it was a picture of a Boa constructor digesting an elephant

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,670
but since the grown ups were not able to understand it

36
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,790
I made another drawing

37
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,920
I drew the inside of a boa constrictor so that the grownups could see it clearly

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,240
They always need to have things explained

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,180
My drawing number two looked like this

40
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,670
The grownups response this time was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors

41
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,710
whether from the inside or the outside

42
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,920
and devote myself instead to geography

43
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,920
historyarithmetic

44
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,100
and grammar

45
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,030
That is why

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,810
at the age of six

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,680
I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:40,200
I had been disheartened by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two grown ups never understand anything by themselves and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them

49
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,490
So then I chose another profession and learned to pilot airplanes

50
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,770
I have flown a little over all parts of the world

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,160
and it is true that geography has been very useful to me

52
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,200
At a glance

53
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,220
I can distinguish China from Arizona

54
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,700
If one gets lost in the night

55
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,050
Such knowledge is valuable

56
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,720
In the course of this life

57
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:17,140
I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence

58
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,430
I have lived a great deal among grown-ups

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,700
I have seen them intimately close at hand

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
and that hasn't much improved my opinion of them

61
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,120
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear sighted

62
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,080
I tried the experiment of showing him my drawing number one

63
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,290
which I have always kept

64
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,920
I would try to find out

65
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,800
So if this was a person of true understanding

66
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,430
but whoever it was

67
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,890
he or she would always say that is a hat

68
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:03,530
Then I would never talk to that person about boa constructors or primeval forests or stars

69
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,010
I would bring myself down to his level

70
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:14,030
I would talk to him about bridge and golf and politics and neckties

71
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,080
and the grown up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,790
Two

73
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:37,360
so I lived my life alone without anyone that I could really talk to until I had an accident with my plane in the desert of Sahara six years ago

74
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,190
Something was broken in my engine

75
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
and as I had with me

76
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,780
neither a mechanic nor any passengers

77
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,390
I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,810
It was a question of life or death for me

79
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,420
I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week the first night

80
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,180
Then I went to sleep on the sand

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,090
1000 miles from any human habitation

82
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:11,180
I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean

83
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:19,510
thus you can imagine my amazement at sunrise when I was awakened by an odd little voice

84
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,100
It said

85
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,840
if you please draw me a sheep

86
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,370
what draw me a sheep

87
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,830
I jumped to my feet

88
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,620
completely thunderstruck

89
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,490
I blinked my eyes hard

90
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,500
I looked carefully all around me

91
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:46,180
and I saw a most extraordinary small person who stood there examining me with great seriousness

92
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,530
Here you may see the best portrait that later I was able to make of him

93
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,570
but my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model

94
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,200
Thathowever

95
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,620
is not my fault

96
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,790
The grown ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old

97
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:13,200
and I never learned to draw anything except boas from the outside and boas from the inside

98
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:22,000
Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment

99
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,350
Remember

100
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,120
I had crashed in the desert

101
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,440
1000 miles from any inhabited region

102
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,080
and yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands

103
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,980
nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear

104
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,780
Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert

105
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,300
1000 miles from any human habitation

106
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,650
When at last I was able to speak

107
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,880
I said to him

108
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,340
but what are you doing here

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,440
And in answer he repeated very slowly

110
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:06,190
as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence

111
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,920
If you please draw me a sheep

112
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,660
when a mystery is too overpowering

113
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
one dare not disobey

114
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,720
Absurd as it might seem to me

115
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,930
1000 miles from any human habitation

116
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,640
and in danger of death

117
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,750
I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain pen

118
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,320
But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography

119
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,140
historyarithmetic

120
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,010
and grammar

121
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,690
and I told the little chap a little crossly

122
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,110
toothat I did not know how to draw

123
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,990
He answered me

124
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,440
that doesn't matter

125
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,930
draw me a sheep

126
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,610
But I had never drawn a sheep

127
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,300
so I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often

128
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,820
It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside

129
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,503
and I was astounded to hear the little fellow greeted with no

130
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:07,990
nono

131
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:12,131
noI do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor

132
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:18,220
A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature and an elephant is very cumbersome

133
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,440
Where I live

134
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,440
everything is very small

135
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,200
what I need is a sheep

136
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,690
draw me a sheep

137
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,960
So then I made a drawing

138
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,340
he looked at it carefully

139
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,340
then he said no

140
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,810
this sheep is already very sickly

141
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,400
make me another

142
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:42,900
So I made another drawing

143
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,620
My friend smiled gently and indulgently

144
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,140
You see yourself

145
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,000
he said that this is not a shape

146
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,520
this is a ram

147
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,790
it has horns

148
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,950
So then I did my drawing over once more

149
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,680
but it was rejected too

150
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,420
just like the others

151
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,550
this one is too old

152
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,190
I want a sheep that will live a long time by this time

153
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,260
my patience was exhausted because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart

154
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:23,480
so I tossed off this drawing and I threw out an explanation with it

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,260
This is only his box

156
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,800
the sheep you asked for is inside

157
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:35,300
I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge

158
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,660
that is exactly the way I wanted it

159
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,670
Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass

160
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,750
why

161
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,920
Because where I live everything is very small

162
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,800
there will surely be enough grass for him

163
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:00,710
I said it is a very small sheep that I have given you he bent his head over the drawing

164
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,040
not so small that look he has gone to sleep

165
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,330
and that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince

166
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,480
Three

167
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,760
it took me a long time to learn where he came from

168
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:29,220
The little prince who asked me so many questions never seemed to hear the ones I asked him

169
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:39,850
It was from words dropped by chance that little by little everything was revealed to me The first time he saw my airplane

170
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,760
For instance

172
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,630
That would be much too complicated for me

173
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,630
He asked me

174
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,940
what is that object

175
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,410
That is not an object

176
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,460
it flies

177
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,700
it is an airplane

178
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,690
it is my airplane

179
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,450
and I was proud to have him learn that I could fly

180
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,760
He cried out then what

181
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,200
you dropped down from the sky

182
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,760
YesI answered modestly

183
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,500
ohthat is funny

184
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,520
And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter

185
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,150
which irritated me very much

186
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,610
I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously

187
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,600
Thenhe added

188
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,380
so you too come from the sky

189
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,390
which is your planet

190
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,150
At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence

191
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,200
and I demanded abruptly

192
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,690
do you come from another planet

193
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,600
But he did not reply

194
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,330
He tossed his head gently

195
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,790
without taking his eyes from my plane

196
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:54,150
It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away

197
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,680
and he sank into a reverie which lasted a long time

198
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,180
Thentaking my sheep out of his pocket

199
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,650
he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure

200
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,700
You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half confidence about the other planets

201
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,130
I made a great effort

202
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,500
thereforeto find out more on this subject

203
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,220
My little man

204
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,390
where do you come from

205
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,840
What is this where I live

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,230
of which you speak

207
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,920
Where do you want to take your sheep

208
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,740
After a reflective silence

209
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:43,810
he answered the thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house

210
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,140
That is so

211
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,360
and if you are good

212
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,050
I will give you a string too

213
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,480
so that you can tie him during the day and a post to tie him to

214
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,720
But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer

215
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,600
Tie him

216
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,570
What a queer idea

217
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,140
But if you don't tie him

218
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:04,980
I said

219
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,720
he will wander off somewhere and get lost

220
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,340
My friend broke into another peal of laughter

221
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,340
but where do you think he would go

222
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,690
Anywhere straight ahead of him

223
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,880
Then the little prince said earnestly

224
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,720
that doesn't matter where I live

225
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,840
everything is so small

226
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,310
and with perhaps a hint of sadness he added straight ahead of him

227
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,660
nobody can go very far

228
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,220
FourI had thus learned a second fact of great importance

229
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:51,130
This was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house

230
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,320
But that did not really surprise me much

231
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,740
I knew very well that in addition to the great planets such as the Earth

232
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,360
Jupiter Mars

233
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,110
Venusto which we have given names

234
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,840
there are also hundreds of others

235
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:12,900
some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope

236
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,990
When an astronomer discovers one of these

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,690
he does not give it a name

238
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,300
but only a number

239
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,680
He might call it

240
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,890
for example

241
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,880
asteroid 325

242
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:34,950
I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B6 1 2

243
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,950
This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope

244
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,630
That was by a Turkish astronomer in 19 oh 9

245
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,090
On making his discovery

246
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:53,880
the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress in a great demonstration

247
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,510
but he was in Turkish costume

248
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,180
and so nobody would believe what he said

249
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,820
Grown ups are like that

250
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,620
Fortunatelyhowever

251
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,400
for the reputation of asteroid B 601 2

252
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,110
a Turkish vector made a law that his subjects

253
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,680
under pain of death

254
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:15,180
should change to European costume

255
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,710
So in 1920

256
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,290
the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again

257
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,360
dressed with impressive style and elegance

258
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,420
and this time everybody accepted his report

259
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,840
If I have told you these details about the asteroid and made a note of its number for you

260
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,170
it is on account of the grown ups and their ways

261
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,280
When you tell them that you have made a new friend

262
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,960
they never ask you any questions about essential matters

263
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,860
They never say to you what does his voice sound like

264
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,380
what games does he love best

265
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,240
Does he collect butterflies

266
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,750
Instead

267
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,830
They demand

268
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,130
how old is he

269
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,880
how many brothers has he

270
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,370
how much does he weigh

271
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,700
how much money does his father make

272
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,760
Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him

273
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,960
If you were to say to the grown ups

274
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:18,000
I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof

275
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,920
they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all

276
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,780
You would have to say to them

277
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,270
I saw a house that cost $20000

278
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,170
Then they would exclaim

279
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,620
ohwhat a pretty house that is

280
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,240
Just so you might say to them

281
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,780
the proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming

282
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,880
that he left

283
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,800
and that he was looking for a sheep

284
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,960
If anybody wants a sheep

285
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,210
that is a proof that he exists

286
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,230
And what good would it do to tell them that they would shrug their shoulders and treat you like a child

287
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,690
But if you said to them the planet he came from is asteroid B 602

288
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,190
then they would be convinced and leave you in peace from their questions

289
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,640
They are like that

290
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,310
One must not hold it against them

291
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,430
Children should always show great forbearance toward grown up people

292
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,990
But certainly for us who understand life figures are a matter of indifference

293
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,390
I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy tales

294
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:38,130
I should have liked to say once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself

295
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:47,840
and who had need of a sheep to those who understand life that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story

296
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,400
for I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly

297
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:57,480
I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories

298
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,980
Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me with his sheep

299
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:13,260
If I try to describe him here it is to make sure that I shall not forget him to forget a friend is sad

300
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,760
not everyone has had a friend

301
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,080
and if I forget him

302
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:24,620
I may become like the grown ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures

303
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,760
It is for that purpose

304
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,750
againthat I have bought a box of paints and some pencils

305
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:43,710
It is hard to take up drawing again at my age when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside since I was 6

306
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,450
I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible

307
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,220
but I am not at all sure of success

308
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,420
One drawing goes along all right

309
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,950
and another has no resemblance to its subject

310
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,630
I make some errors too in the little princess height in one place

311
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,750
he is too tall and in another too short

312
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,200
and I feel some doubts about the color of his costume

313
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,860
so I fumble along as best I can

314
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,780
Now good

315
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,220
now bad

316
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,150
and I hope

317
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,440
generally fair to middling in certain more important details

318
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,620
I shall make mistakes also

319
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,630
but that is something that will not be my fault

320
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,280
My friend never explained anything to me

321
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,890
He thought perhaps that I was like himself

322
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,060
but I

323
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,380
alasdo not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes

324
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,610
Perhaps I am a little like the grown ups I have had to grow old

325
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:57,980
Five

326
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,030
as each day passed

327
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,520
I would learn in our talk something about the little prince's planet

328
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,020
his departure from it

329
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,630
his journey

330
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,840
The information would come very slowly

331
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,140
as it might chance to fall from his thoughts

332
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:22,130
It was in this way that I heard on the third day about the catastrophe of the baobabs

333
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,890
This time

334
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,580
once more I had the sheep to think for it

335
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,280
for the little prince asked me abruptly

336
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,540
as if seized by a grave doubt

337
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,990
It is true

338
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,800
isn't it

339
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,800
that sheep eat little bushes

340
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,140
Yesthat is true

341
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:48,670
I am glad I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes

342
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,640
but the little prince added

343
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,930
then it follows that they also eat baobabs

344
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,950
I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushy

345
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,430
but on the contrary

346
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,900
trees as big as castles

347
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,940
and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him

348
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,040
the herd would not eat up one single baobab

349
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:18,350
The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh

350
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,270
We would have to put them one on top of the other

351
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,420
he said

352
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,270
but he made a wise comment before they grow so big

353
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:32,140
The bow Babs start out by being little

354
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,810
That is strictly correct

355
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,840
I said

356
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,820
but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs

357
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,270
He answered me at once

358
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:43,798
Ohcome

359
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:44,327
comecome

360
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:48,820
comeas if he were speaking of something that was self evident

361
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,120
and I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem without any assistance

362
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:56,990
Indeed

363
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,230
as I learned

364
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,610
there were on the planet where the little prince lived

365
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,240
as on all planets

366
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,090
good plants and bad plants

367
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,900
In consequence

368
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,740
there were good seeds from good plants and bad seeds from bad plants

369
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,760
But seeds are invisible

370
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:23,980
They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness until someone among them is seized with the desire to awaken

371
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,980
Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin

372
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,970
timidly at first

373
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:34,870
to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun

374
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,330
if it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose bush

375
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,050
1 would let it grow wherever it might wish

376
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,590
But when it is a bad plant

377
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,810
one must destroy it as soon as possible

378
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:52,240
the very first instant that one recognizes it

379
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,840
Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince

380
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,720
and these were the seeds of the baobab

381
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,520
the soil of that planet was infested with them

382
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,990
A baobab is something you will never

383
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,080
never be able to get rid of If you attend to it too late

384
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,740
it spreads over the entire planet

385
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,570
it bores clear through it with its roots

386
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,140
and if the planet is too small and the bow babs are too many

387
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,640
they split it in pieces

388
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,120
it is a question of discipline

389
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,810
the little prince said to me later on

390
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:40,960
when you finish your own toilet in the morning then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet

391
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:52,880
just so with the greatest care you must see to it that you pull up regularly all the bow Babs at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rose bushes

392
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,350
which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth

393
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,550
It is very tedious work

394
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,930
the little prince added

395
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:10,610
but very easy and one day he said to me you ought to make a beautiful drawing

396
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:19,440
so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is that would be very useful to them if they were to travel someday

397
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:26,330
sometimes he added there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day

398
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,030
but when it is a matter of baobabs

399
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,810
that always means a catastrophe

400
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:37,810
I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man he neglected three little bushes

401
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:48,600
so as the little prince described it to me I have made a drying of that planet I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist

402
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,170
but the danger of the baobabs is so little understood

403
00:25:52,530 --> 00:26:18,540
and such considerable risk would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid that for once I am breaking through my reserve children I say plainly watch out for the baobabs my friends like myself have been skirting this danger for a long time without ever knowing it

404
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:29,600
and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing the lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me

405
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:38,990
perhaps you will ask me why are there no other drawings in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs

406
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,800
the reply is simple I have tried

407
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:56,450
but with the others I have not been successful when I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity

408
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,930
Six

409
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,250
ohlittle prince

410
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,440
Bit by bit

411
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,370
I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life

412
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:18,020
For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset

413
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,340
I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day when you said to me

414
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,530
I am very fond of sunsets

415
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,280
Come

416
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,580
let us go look at a sunset now

417
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,620
But we must wait

418
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,800
I said

419
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,620
wait for what

420
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,660
For the sunset

421
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,780
we must wait until it is time

422
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,420
At first you seemed to be very much surprised

423
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,810
and then you laughed to yourself

424
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,040
you said to me I am always thinking that I am at home

425
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:55,400
just so everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States

426
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,120
the sun is setting over France

427
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,100
If you could fly to France in one minute

428
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,210
you could go straight into the sunset right from noon

429
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,350
UnfortunatelyFrance is too far away for that

430
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,590
but on your tiny planet

431
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,670
my little prince

432
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,700
all you need to do is move your chair a few steps

433
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,200
you can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like

434
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,320
One day you said to me

435
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,760
I saw the sunset 44 times and a little later you added

436
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,160
you know

437
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,860
one loves the sunset when one is so sad

438
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:40,940
Were you so sad

439
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,380
Then I asked on the day of the 44 sunsets

440
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,270
but the little prince made no reply

441
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,340
Seven on the fifth day

442
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,030
Againas always

443
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,460
it was thanks to the sheep

444
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,440
The secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me abruptly

445
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,560
without anything to lead up to it

446
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:13,130
and as if the question had been born of long and science meditation on his problem

447
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,500
he demanded a sheep

448
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,600
If it eats little bushes

449
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,730
does it eat flowers too

450
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,050
A sheep

451
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,990
I answered

452
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,410
eats anything it finds in its reach

453
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,520
Even flowers that have thorns

454
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,490
Yeseven flowers that have thorns

455
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,630
Then the thorns

456
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,620
what use are they

457
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,170
I did not know

458
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:48,400
At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine

459
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,690
I was very much worried

460
00:29:50,700 --> 00:30:02,410
for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious and I had so little drinking water left that I had to fear for the worst

461
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,650
The thorns

462
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,220
What use are they

463
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:12,420
The little Prince never let go of a question once he had asked it

464
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,820
as for me

465
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:20,560
I was upset over that bolt and I answered with the first thing that came into my head

466
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,230
The thorns are of no use at all

467
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,860
Flowers have thorns just for spite

468
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,980
Ohthere was a moment of complete silence

469
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,200
then the little prince flashed back at me with a kind of resentfulness

470
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,450
I don't believe you

471
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,800
flowers are weak creatures

472
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,970
they are naivety

473
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,240
they reassure themselves as best they can

474
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,040
they believe that their thorns are terrible weapons

475
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,550
I did not answer at that instant

476
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,630
I was saying to myself

477
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,380
if this bolt still won't turn

478
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:05,670
I am going to knock it out with the hammer again

479
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,395
The little prince disturbed my thoughts and you actually believe that the flowers

480
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:11,915
Oh no

481
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:12,694
I cried

482
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:13,213
Nono

483
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:13,732
nono

484
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:16,069
noI don't believe anything

485
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:20,223
I answered you with the first thing that came into my head

486
00:31:20,223 --> 00:31:21,261
Don't you see

487
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:24,160
I am very busy with of consequence

488
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,550
He stared at me

489
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:31,230
thunderstruckmatters of consequence

490
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:35,580
He looked at me there with my hammer in my hand

491
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,120
my fingers black with engine grace

492
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,860
bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly

493
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:51,410
You talk just like the grownups that made me a little ashamed

494
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,100
But he went on relentlessly

495
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,770
You mix everything up together

496
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,780
you confuse everything

497
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,870
He was really very angry

498
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,780
He tossed his golden curls in the breeze

499
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,990
I know a planet where there is a certain red faced gentleman

500
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,280
he has never smelled a flower

501
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,120
he has never looked at a star

502
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,260
he has never loved anyone

503
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,480
he has never done anything in his life but add up figures

504
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,390
And all day he says over and over

505
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,660
just like you

506
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,840
I am busy with matters of consequence and that makes him swell up with pride

507
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,950
But he is not a man

508
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:34,960
he is a mushroom

509
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,030
A what

510
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,580
a mushroom

511
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,230
the little prince was now white with rage

512
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:46,590
the flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years

513
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,820
For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same

514
00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:00,880
and it is not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them

515
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,740
is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important

516
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:10,600
Is this not of more consequence than a fat red faced gentleman's sums

517
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,810
And if I know I myself 1 flower which is unique in the world

518
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,540
which grows nowhere but on my planet

519
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:25,990
but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning without even noticing what he is doing

520
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,560
Ohyou think that is not important

521
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:34,480
His face turned from white to red as he continued

522
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:43,490
If someone loves a flower of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars

523
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,560
it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars

524
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,100
He can say to himself somewhere

525
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,930
my flower is there

526
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,120
But if the sheep eats the flower in one moment

527
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,570
all his stars will be darkened

528
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,030
And you think that is not important

529
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,680
He could not say anything more

530
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,790
His words were choked by sobbing

531
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,230
The night had fallen

532
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,440
I had let my tools drop from my hands

533
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,790
Of what moment now was my hammer

534
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,020
my bolt

535
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,980
or thirst or death on one star

536
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,480
1 planet

537
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,980
my planet

538
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:28,970
the earth

539
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,140
there was a little prince to be comforted

540
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,690
I took him in my arms and rocked him

541
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,580
I said to him

542
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,100
the flower that you love is not in danger

543
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,280
I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep

544
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,240
I will draw you a railing to put around your flower

545
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,850
I will

546
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,140
I did not know what to say to him

547
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,750
I felt awkward and blundering

548
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,800
I did not know how I could reach him

549
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,400
where I could overtake him

550
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,210
and go on hand in hand with him once more

551
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,360
It is such a secret place

552
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,300
the land of tears

553
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,300
Eight

554
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,830
I soon learned to know this flower better on the little princess planet

555
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,750
The flowers had always been very simple

556
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,660
They had only one ring of petals

557
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,680
they took up no room at all

558
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,350
they were a trouble to nobody

559
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,250
One morning they would appear in the grass

560
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,810
and by night they would have faded peacefully away

561
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,650
But one day

562
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,550
from a seed blown from no one knew where

563
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,500
a new flower had come up

564
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,770
and the little prince had watched very closely over the small sprout

565
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,660
which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet

566
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,710
It might

567
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,520
you see

568
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,950
have been a new kind of baobab

569
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:05,880
The shrub soon stopped growing and began to get ready to produce a flower

570
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,960
The little prince

571
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,290
who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud

572
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,920
felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it

573
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,240
But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty

574
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,270
In the shelter of her green chamber

575
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,010
she chose her colors with the greatest care

576
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,340
She dressed herself ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌slowly

577
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,040
she adjusted her petals 1 by one

578
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,830
She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled like the field poppies

579
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:45,820
It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear

580
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,850
Oh yes

581
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:50,630
she was a coquettish creature

582
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,610
and her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days

583
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,780
Then one morning

584
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,650
exactly at sunrise

585
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,000
she suddenly showed herself

586
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,320
and after working with all this painstaking precision

587
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,680
she yawned and said

588
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,460
I am scarcely awake

589
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,210
I beg that you will excuse me

590
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,840
My petals are still all disarranged

591
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:22,160
but the li​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ttle prince could not restrain his admiration

592
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,580
Ohhow beautiful you are

593
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,340
am I not

594
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,710
The flower responded sweetly

595
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,410
and I was born at the same moment as the sun

596
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,640
The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest

597
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,270
but how moving and exciting she was

598
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,830
I think it is time for breakfast

599
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,620
she added

600
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,750
An instant later

601
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,090
if you would have the kindness to think of my needs

602
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,380
and the little prince

603
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,900
completely abashed

604
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,930
went to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water

605
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,860
so he tended the flower

606
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:05,920
so too she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity

607
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,010
which was

608
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:08,530
if the truth be known

609
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,400
a little difficult to deal with

610
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,540
One day

611
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,470
for instance

612
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,100
when she was speaking of her four thorns

613
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,990
she said to the little prince

614
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,580
let the tigers come with their claws

615
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,950
There are no tigers on my planet

616
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,650
the little prince objected

617
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,350
and anyway tigers do not eat weeds

618
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,270
I am not a weed

619
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,480
the flower replied sweetly

620
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,960
Please excuse me

621
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,700
I am not at all afraid of tigers

622
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,090
she went on

623
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,980
but I have a horror of giraffes

624
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,240
I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me

625
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,020
a horror of giraffes

626
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,420
that is bad luck for a plant

627
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,730
remarked the little prince

628
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,470
and added to himself

629
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:59,950
this flower is a very complex creature

630
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:05,260
At night I want you to put me under a glass globe

631
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,700
It is very cold where you live

632
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,070
in the place I came from

633
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,420
but she interrupted herself at that point she had come in the form of a seed

634
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,440
she could not have known anything of any other worlds

635
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:25,740
embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naive untruth

636
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:33,200
she coughed two or three times in order to put the little prince in the wrong the screen

637
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,370
I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me

638
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,600
then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same

639
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:48,500
so the little prince in spite of all the goodwill that was inseparable from his love

640
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,550
had soon come to doubt her

641
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:55,000
He had taken seriously words which were without importance

642
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,680
and it made him very unhappy

643
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,320
I ought not to have listened to her

644
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,240
He confided to me one day

645
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,740
one never ought to listen to the flowers

646
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,880
one should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance

647
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:13,930
mine perfumed all my planet

648
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,830
but I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace

649
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,940
This tale of claws

650
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,170
which disturbed me so much

651
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,880
should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity

652
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,040
and he continued his confidences

653
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:37,660
The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words

654
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:41,250
She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me

655
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,740
I ought never to have run away from her

656
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,460
I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her

657
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,170
poor little stratagems

658
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,750
Flowers are so inconsistent

659
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,060
but I was too young to know how to love her

660
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,340
Nine

661
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,350
I believe that for his escape

662
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,480
he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds

663
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,780
On the morning of his departure

664
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:13,810
he put his planet in perfect order

665
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,330
He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes

666
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,350
He possessed two active volcanoes

667
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,340
and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning

668
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,650
He also had one volcano that was extinct

669
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,180
but as he said

670
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,750
one never knows

671
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,440
So he cleaned out the extinct volcano

672
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,510
Twoif they are well cleaned out

673
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,500
volcanoes burn slowly and steadily without any eruptions

674
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:48,150
Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney on our earth

675
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,290
We are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes

676
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,350
that is why they bring no end of trouble upon us

677
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,080
The little prince also pulled up with a certain sense of dejection

678
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:04,620
the last little shoots of the baobabs

679
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,350
He believed that he would never want to return

680
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:14,380
but on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him

681
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:21,200
and when he watered the flower for the last time and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe

682
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:25,270
he realized that he was very close to tears

683
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,480
Good bye

684
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,420
he said to the flower

685
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,540
but she made no answer

686
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,020
Goodbyehe said again

687
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,550
The flower coughed

688
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,090
but it was not because she had a cold

689
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,990
I have been silly

690
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:55,820
she said to him at last I ask your forgiveness try to be happy he was surprised by this absence of reproaches

691
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,210
He stood there all bewildered

692
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,460
the glass globe held

693
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,060
arrested in mid air

694
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,280
He did not understand this quiet sweetness

695
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,000
Of course I love you

696
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,940
the flower said to him

697
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,030
it is my fault that you have not known it all the while

698
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,900
that is of no importance

699
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,040
but you have been just as foolish as I try to be happy

700
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,350
let the glass globe be

701
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
I don't want it any more

702
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,380
but the wind

703
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,500
my cold

704
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:35,540
is not so bad as all that the cool night air will do me good

705
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,170
I am a flower

706
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,690
but the animals well

707
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:49,090
I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies

708
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,040
it seems that they are very beautiful

709
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:56,860
and if not the butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me

710
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:59,080
you will be far away

711
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,610
As for the large animals

712
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,380
I am not at all afraid of any of them

713
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,620
I have my claws

714
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,650
and naively she showed her four thorns

715
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,180
then she added

716
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,210
don't linger like this

717
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,450
you have decided to go away

718
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,200
now go for she did not want him to see her crying

719
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,100
She was such a proud flower

720
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,020
10

721
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,730
he found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids

722
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,560
325 3 2 6 3 2 7

723
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,030
32 8 3 2 9

724
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,910
and 3 3 0

725
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,090
He began

726
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,880
thereforeby fisting them in order to add to his knowledge

727
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:58,520
The first of them was inhabited by a king clad in royal purple and ermine

728
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:05,000
He was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic

729
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,730
Here is a subject

730
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,350
exclaimed the king

731
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,610
when he saw the little prince coming

732
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,950
and the little prince asked himself

733
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,220
how could he recognize me when he had never seen me before

734
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,450
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings to them

735
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,570
all men are subjects

736
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,880
Approach so that I may see you better

737
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,850
said the king

738
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,910
who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody

739
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,250
The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down

740
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:46,970
but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe

741
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:49,420
so he remained standing upright

742
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,920
and since he was tired he yawned

743
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,280
It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king

744
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,270
The monarch said to him

745
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,800
I forbid you to do so

746
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,300
I can't help it

747
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,330
I can't stop myself

748
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,860
replied the little prince

749
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,850
Thoroughly embarrassed

750
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:14,910
I have come on a long journey

751
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,900
and I have had no sleep

752
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,880
Then the king said I order you to yawn

753
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,380
It is years since I have seen anyone yawning

754
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,590
Yawns to me are objects of curiosity

755
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:31,060
Come now

756
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:32,320
yawn again

757
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:36,610
It is an order that frightens me

758
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,860
I cannot any more

759
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,460
murmured the little prince

760
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,260
now completely abashed

761
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,986
Humreplied the king

762
00:46:44,986 --> 00:46:51,193
then I order you sometimes to yawn

763
00:46:51,193 --> 00:46:53,580
and sometimes to

764
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:55,430
he sputtered a little

765
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,020
and seemed vexed

766
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:03,940
for what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected

767
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,120
He tolerated no disobedience

768
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,200
he was an absolute monarch

769
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:13,170
but because he was a very good man

770
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,460
he made his orders reasonable

771
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:18,270
If I ordered a general

772
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,390
he would say by way of example

773
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,670
if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bud

774
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,180
and if the general did not obey me

775
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,770
that would not be the fault of the general

776
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,730
It would be my fault

777
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,790
May I sit down

778
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,240
Came now a timid inquiry from the little Prince

779
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,970
I order you to do so

780
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,390
the king answered him

781
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,870
and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle

782
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:53,360
but the little prince was wondering the planet was tiny over what could this king really rule

783
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,470
Sire

784
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,780
he said to him

785
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,770
I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question

786
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:03,810
I order you to ask me a question

787
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:06,160
the king hastened to assure him

788
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,370
sireover

789
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,970
what do you rule for everything

790
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:23,320
said the king with magnificent simplicity over everything the king made a gesture which took in his planet the other planets

791
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,840
and all the stars over all that

792
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,690
asked the little prince

793
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,680
over all that the king answered

794
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,760
for his rule was not only absolute

795
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,240
it was also universal

796
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,120
and the stars obey you

797
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,600
certainly they do

798
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,630
the king said they obey instantly

799
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:50,450
I do not permit insubordination

800
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,970
such power was a thing

801
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,100
for the little prince to marvel at

802
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:04,310
if he had been master of such complete authority he would have been able to watch the sunset not 44 times in one day

803
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,530
but 72 or even 100

804
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:12,580
or even 200 times without ever having to move his chair

805
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:17,690
and because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken

806
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,310
he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor

807
00:49:22,310 --> 00:49:24,720
I should like to see a sunset

808
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:33,790
do me that kindness order the sun to set if I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another

809
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,110
like a butterfly

810
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,380
or to write a tragic drama ought to change himself into a sea bird

811
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:45,740
and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received

812
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,470
which one of us would be in the wrong

813
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:52,610
the king demanded the general or myself

814
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,980
you said the little prince firmly

815
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:05,110
exactly one must require from each one the duty which each one can perform the king went on

816
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,340
accepted authority rests first of all on reason

817
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,370
if you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea

818
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,890
they would rise up in revolution

819
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:21,000
I have the right to require obedience

820
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,210
because my orders are reasonable

821
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,180
then my sunset

822
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,940
the little prince reminded him

823
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,090
for he never forgot a question

824
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,460
once he had asked it

825
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,750
you shall have your sunset

826
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,430
I shall command it

827
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:40,660
but according to my science of government

828
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,050
I shall wait until conditions are favorable

829
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,960
when will that be inquired the little prince hum

830
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,850
humhum

831
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,510
replied the king

832
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:57,060
and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac

833
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:07,420
hum that will be about about that will be this evening about 20 minutes to 8

834
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,570
and you will see how well I am obeyed

835
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,290
The little prince yawned

836
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,170
He was regretting his lost sunset

837
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:17,840
and then

838
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,660
toohe was already beginning to be a little bored

839
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:24,350
I have nothing more to do here

840
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,700
he said to the king

841
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,220
so I shall set out on my way again

842
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,820
Do not go

843
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,730
said the king

844
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,090
who was very proud of having a subject

845
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,670
Do not go

846
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:36,420
I will make you a minister

847
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,100
Minister of what

848
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,260
Minister of of justice

849
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:46,090
But there is nobody here to judge

850
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,290
We do not know that the king said to him

851
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,510
I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom

852
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,690
I am very old

853
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,680
there is no room here for a carriage

854
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:02,040
it tires me to walk

855
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,480
Oh

856
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,320
but I have looked already

857
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:06,700
said the little prince

858
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:10,700
turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet

859
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,500
On that side

860
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,840
as on this

861
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,960
there was nobody at all

862
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,530
Then you shall judge yourself

863
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,020
the king answered

864
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:23,070
That is the most difficult thing of all

865
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,340
It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge authors

866
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:31,100
If you succeed in judging yourself rightly

867
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:36,660
then you are indeed a man of true wisdom

868
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,640
Yes

869
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,200
said the little prince

870
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,710
but I can judge myself anywhere

871
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,990
I do not need to live on this planet

872
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:46,097
Humhum

873
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:47,451
humsaid the king

874
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:54,900
I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat

875
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:56,940
I hear him at night

876
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:00,480
You can judge this old rat from time to time

877
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,330
You will condemn him to death

878
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,380
Thus his life will depend on your justice

879
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,850
but you will pardon him on each occasion

880
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,150
for he must be treated thriftily

881
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:12,380
He is the only one we have

882
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,360
I replied

883
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,320
The little prince do not like to condemn anyone to death

884
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,940
and now I think I will go on my way

885
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,360
Nosaid the king

886
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,980
but the little prince

887
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:27,990
having now completed his preparations for departure

888
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,470
had no wish to grieve the old monarch

889
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,790
If your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed

890
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,780
he said

891
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,690
he should be able to give me a reasonable order

892
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,340
He should be able

893
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:41,370
for example

894
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,750
to order me to be gone by the end of one minute

895
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,340
It seems to me that conditions are favorable

896
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,180
as the king made no answer

897
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:53,280
The little prince hesitated a moment

898
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,110
thenwith a sigh

899
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,870
he took his leave

900
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,770
I make you my ambassador

901
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,160
the king called out hastily

902
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:04,280
He had a magnificent air of authority

903
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:07,330
The grown ups are very strange

904
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,870
the little prince said to himself as he continued on his journey

905
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,100
11

906
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,640
the second planet

907
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,730
was inhabited by a conceited man

908
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,860
I am about to receive a visit from an admirer

909
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,930
he exclaimed from afar when he first saw the little prince coming

910
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,340
for to conceited men all other men are admirers

911
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,000
Good morning

912
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,400
said the little prince

913
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:45,030
that is a queer hat you are wearing

914
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,340
It is a hut for salutes

915
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,110
the conceited man replied

916
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,600
It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me

917
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,650
Unfortunatelynobody at all ever passes this way

918
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,680
Yessaid the little prince

919
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:06,660
who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about

920
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,240
clap your hands

921
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,630
one against the other

922
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,500
the conceited man now directed him

923
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:16,520
the little prince clapped his hands

924
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,520
the conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute

925
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,210
This is more entertaining than the visit to the king

926
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:26,570
the little prince said to himself

927
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,800
and he began again to clap his hands

928
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:30,550
one against the other

929
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:37,320
The conceited man again raised his hat in salute after five minutes of this exercise

930
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:40,490
the little prince grouped tired of the game's monotony

931
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,680
and what should one do to make the hat come down

932
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,710
he asked

933
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,420
But the conceited man did not hear him

934
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,480
Conceited people never hear anything but praise

935
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:56,130
Do you really admire me very much

936
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:58,140
he demanded of the little prince

937
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,380
What does that mean

938
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:07,680
Admire to admire means that you regard me as the handsomest

939
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,760
the best dressed the richest

940
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,760
and the most intelligent man on this planet

941
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,540
But you are the only man on your planet

942
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,840
Do me this kindness

943
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,540
admire me just the same

944
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,770
I admire you

945
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,180
said the little prince

946
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,950
shrugging his shoulder slightly

947
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,850
but what is there in that to interest you so much

948
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,780
And the little prince went away

949
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,700
The grown ups are certainly very odd

950
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,730
he said to himself as he continued on his journey

951
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:53,180
12 the next planet was inhabited by a tippler

952
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,040
This was a very short visit

953
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:59,700
but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection

954
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,990
What are you doing there

955
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,330
He said to the tippler

956
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:11,350
whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles

957
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,540
I'm drinking

958
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,980
replied the Tippler with a lugubrious air

959
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,580
Why are you drinking

960
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,170
demanded the little prince

961
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,390
So that I may forget

962
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:27,970
replied the tippler

963
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:29,970
Forget what

964
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,910
inquired the little prince

965
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,250
who already was sorry for him

966
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,580
Forget that I am ashamed

967
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,510
the tippler confessed

968
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,860
hanging his head

969
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:47,860
ashamed of what insisted the little prince who wanted to help him

970
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,260
ashamed of drinking the tippler

971
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,440
brought his speech to an end and shut himself up in an impregnable silence

972
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,520
and the little prince went away puzzled

973
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:04,200
The grown ups are certainly very

13

977
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:19,000
the fourth planet belonged to a businessman

978
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:25,780
This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival

979
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,790
Good morning

980
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,700
the little prince said to him

981
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,940
Your cigarette has gone out

982
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,690
Three and 2 make 5

983
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,220
5 and 7 make 12 and 3 make 15

984
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:36,850
Good morning

985
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,310
15 and 7 make 22

986
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,830
22 and 6 make 28

987
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,240
I haven't time to light it again

988
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,340
26 and 5 make 31 few

989
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,230
Then that makes 501622731 500 million

990
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:52,750
What asked the little prince

991
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,260
ehare you still there

992
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,450
501 million

993
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,200
I can't stop

994
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:57,190
I have so much to do

995
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,810
I'm concerned with matters of consequence

996
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:10,720
I don't amuse myself with baldar dash 2 and 5 make 7 501 million What repeated the little prince who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it

997
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,980
The business man raised his head during the 44 years that I have inhabited this planet

998
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,150
I have been disturbed only three times

999
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,710
The first time was 22 years ago when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where

1000
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,030
He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place

1001
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,260
and I made four mistakes in my edition

1002
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:30,170
The second time

1003
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:31,170
11 years ago

1004
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,840
I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism

1005
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,480
I don't get enough exercise

1006
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:38,240
I have no time for loafing the third time

1007
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,850
Wellthis is it

1008
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:43,150
I was saying then 501 millions

1009
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,620
millions of what

1010
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:52,250
The business man suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question

1011
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:54,980
Millions of those little objects

1012
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:55,700
he said

1013
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:59,840
which one sometimes sees in the sky flies

1014
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,070
Ohno

1015
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,780
little glittering objects

1016
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:04,990
Peaceoh no

1017
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,220
little golden objects

1018
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,210
That's a lazy man title dreaming

1019
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,270
As for me

1020
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,660
I am concerned with matters of consequence

1021
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:14,270
There is no time for idle dreaming in my life

1022
01:00:15,610 --> 01:00:17,480
You mean the stars

1023
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:18,320
Yesthat's it

1024
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,480
the stars

1025
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:23,050
and what do you do with 500 millions of stars

1026
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,010
501622731

1027
01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:29,190
I am concerned with matters of consequence

1028
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,500
I am accurate

1029
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,490
And what do you do with these stars

1030
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:35,910
what do I do with them

1031
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,830
Yesnothing

1032
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,680
I owned them

1033
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,490
You own the stars

1034
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,930
yesbut I have already seen a king who kings do not own

1035
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:53,230
they reign over is a very different matter and what good does it do you to own the stars

1036
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,450
It does me the good of making me rich

1037
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:59,250
and what good does it do you to be rich

1038
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:03,240
It makes it possible for me to buy more stocks if any are discovered

1039
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,290
This man

1040
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,290
the little prince said to himself

1041
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,370
reasons a little like my poor tippler

1042
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,370
nevertheless he still had some more questions

1043
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,790
How is it possible for one to own the stars

1044
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:20,530
To whom do they belong

1045
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,840
The business man retorted peevishly

1046
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,420
I don't know to nobody

1047
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,700
then they belong to me

1048
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,550
because I was the first person to think of it

1049
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:32,460
Is that all that is necessary

1050
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,560
certainly when you find a diamond that belongs to nobody

1051
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,310
it is yours

1052
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:38,590
when you discover an island that belongs to nobody

1053
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,430
made it yours

1054
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,660
When you get an idea before anyone else

1055
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,070
you take out a patent on it

1056
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,250
it is yours

1057
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,180
So with me

1058
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:48,740
I own the stars because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them

1059
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,290
Yes

1060
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,880
that is true

1061
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,230
said the little prince

1062
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,380
and what do you do with them

1063
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:57,490
I administer them

1064
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,820
replied the businessman

1065
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:00,490
I count them and recount them

1066
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,390
It is difficult

1067
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,210
but I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence

1068
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,580
The little prince was still not satisfied

1069
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:12,760
If I owned a silk scarf

1070
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,860
he said

1071
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,240
I could put it around my neck and take it away with me

1072
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,100
If I owned a flower

1073
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:21,950
I could pluck that flower and take it away with me

1074
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,120
But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven

1075
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,930
Nobut I can put them in the bank

1076
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,480
whatever does that mean

1077
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,080
That means I write the number of my stars on a little paper

1078
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,120
and then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key

1079
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:39,750
and that is all

1080
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,900
That is enough

1081
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:41,740
said the business

1082
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:42,480
man

1083
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:45,200
It is entertaining

1084
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,640
thought the little prince

1085
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,970
It is rather poetic

1086
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,290
but it is of no great consequence

1087
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,730
On matters of consequence

1088
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:58,200
the Little Prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown ups

1089
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,060
I myself own a flower

1090
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:04,130
He continued his conversation with the businessman

1091
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:06,480
which I water every day

1092
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,110
I own three volcanoes

1093
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,380
which I clean out every week

1094
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,010
for I also clean out the one that is extinct

1095
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:18,020
One never knows it is of some use to my volcanoes

1096
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:21,330
and it is of some use to my flower that I owned them

1097
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,350
But you are of no use to the stars

1098
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,810
The businessman opened his mouth

1099
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:33,100
but he found nothing to say in answer and the little prince went away

1100
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:38,500
The grown ups are certainly altogether extraordinary

1101
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,310
he said

1102
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:44,630
simply talking to himself as he continued on his journey

1103
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,740
14

1104
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,980
the fifth planet was very strange

1105
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,520
It was the smallest of all

1106
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:00,750
There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamp lighter

1107
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:14,120
The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamp lighter somewhere in the heavens on a planet which had no people and not one house

1108
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:15,800
But he said to himself

1109
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:20,590
neverthelessit may well be that this man is absurd

1110
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:23,110
but he is not so absurd as the king

1111
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,370
the conceited man

1112
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:25,480
the business man

1113
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:26,670
and the tippler

1114
01:04:26,790 --> 01:04:29,260
For at least his work has some meaning

1115
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,270
When he lights his street lamp

1116
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:34,310
it is as if he brought one more star to life

1117
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,780
or one flower

1118
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:37,500
When he puts out his lamp

1119
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,700
he sends the flower or the star to sleep

1120
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,450
That is a beautiful occupation

1121
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:45,230
and since it is beautiful

1122
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:47,510
it is truly useful

1123
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,060
When he arrived on the planet

1124
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,960
he respectfully saluted the lamplighter

1125
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,640
Good morning

1126
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,970
why have you just put out your lamp

1127
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,920
Those are the orders

1128
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:01,840
replied the lamplighter Good morning

1129
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:03,680
What are the orders

1130
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:06,780
The orders are that I put out my lamp

1131
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:07,660
good evening

1132
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:10,280
and he lighted his lamp again

1133
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:13,600
But why have you just lighted it again

1134
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,850
Those are the orders

1135
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,700
replied the lamplighter

1136
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,980
I do not understand

1137
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,510
said the little prince

1138
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:24,210
There is nothing to understand

1139
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,570
said the lamplighter

1140
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,240
orders are orders

1141
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,640
Good morning

1142
01:05:28,790 --> 01:05:30,830
and he put out his lamp

1143
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:35,560
then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares

1144
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,330
I follow a terrible profession

1145
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:41,530
In the old days it was reasonable

1146
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,360
I put the lamp out in the morning

1147
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:45,740
and in the evening I lodged it again

1148
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,520
I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep

1149
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,550
and the orders have been changed since that time

1150
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,630
The orders have not been changed

1151
01:05:57,670 --> 01:05:58,940
said the lamplighter

1152
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,640
That is the tragedy

1153
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:06,210
From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed

1154
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,910
Then what asked the little prince

1155
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,100
then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute

1156
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:16,470
and I no longer have a single second for repose

1157
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:19,990
once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out

1158
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,900
That is very funny

1159
01:06:23,030 --> 01:06:24,780
A day lasts only one minute

1160
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,860
Here where you live

1161
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,220
it is not funny at all

1162
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:29,820
said the lamplighter

1163
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:34,620
while we have been talking together a month has gone by a month

1164
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:36,810
yesa month

1165
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,980
40 minutes

1166
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:39,410
30 days

1167
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:41,170
good evening

1168
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,430
and he lighted his lamp again

1169
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:45,790
as the little prince watched him

1170
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,140
he felt that he loved this lamp lighter

1171
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:57,350
who was so faithful to his orders he remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek in other days merely by pulling up his chair

1172
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,500
and he wanted to help his friend

1173
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:01,390
You know

1174
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,380
he said

1175
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,730
I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to

1176
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,510
I always want to rest

1177
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,100
said the lamplighter

1178
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:15,220
for it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time

1179
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,680
The little prince went on with his explanation

1180
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:27,140
Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it to be always in the sunshine

1181
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:31,720
you need only walk along rather slowly when you want to rest

1182
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:32,770
you will work

1183
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,710
and the day will last as long as you like

1184
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:38,950
That doesn't do me much good

1185
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,350
said the lamp ladder

1186
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,810
The one thing I love in life is to sleep

1187
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,720
then you're unlucky

1188
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,330
said the little prince

1189
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,500
I am unlucky

1190
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:51,310
said the lamplighter

1191
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:54,920
good morning and he put out his lamp

1192
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:56,970
that man

1193
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:01,460
said the little prince to himself as he continued farther on his journey

1194
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,480
That man would be scorned by all the others

1195
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:06,620
by the king

1196
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:08,230
by the conceited man

1197
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:09,500
by the tippler

1198
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:11,250
by the business man

1199
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:17,500
Neverthelesshe is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous

1200
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:22,240
Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself

1201
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:26,980
He breathed a sigh of regret and said to himself again

1202
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:32,290
that man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend

1203
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:35,460
but his planet is indeed too small

1204
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,330
There was no room on it for two people

1205
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:51,160
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet because it was blessed every day with 1440 sunsets

1206
01:08:55,530 --> 01:09:02,590
15 The sixth planet was 10 times larger than the last one

1207
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,880
It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books

1208
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:09,960
Ohlook

1209
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,480
here is an explorer

1210
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,220
he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming

1211
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:20,020
The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little

1212
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,980
He had already travelled so much and so far

1213
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,360
Where do you come from

1214
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,590
The old gentleman said to him

1215
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,910
What is that big book

1216
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,440
said the little prince

1217
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:33,760
what are you doing

1218
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,130
I am a geographer

1219
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:37,790
said the old gentleman

1220
01:09:38,610 --> 01:09:40,720
What is a geographer

1221
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,670
asked the little prince

1222
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:48,060
A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas

1223
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,810
riverstowns

1224
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:52,400
mountains and deserts

1225
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,410
That is very interesting

1226
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:56,810
said the l​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ittle prince

1227
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:00,770
Here at last is a man who has a real profession

1228
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,060
and he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer

1229
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:10,890
It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen

1230
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,150
Your planet is very beautiful

1231
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,170
he said

1232
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:17,930
Has it any oceans

1233
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,090
I couldn't tell you

1234
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,600
said the geographer

1235
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,500
The little prince was disappointed

1236
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,930
Has it any mountains

1237
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:29,990
I couldn't tell you

1238
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:31,380
said the geographer

1239
01:10:31,890 --> 01:10:34,840
and towns and rivers and deserts

1240
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,270
I couldn't tell you that either

1241
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:40,340
but you are a geographer

1242
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,690
exactlythe geographer said

1243
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:45,820
but I am not an explorer

1244
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,770
I haven't a single explorer on my planet

1245
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,340
It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns

1246
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,090
the rivers

1247
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:54,790
the mountains

1248
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:55,340
the siege

1249
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:55,940
the oceans

1250
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:56,860
and the deserts

1251
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,310
The geographer is much too important to go loafing about

1252
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:03,200
He does not leave his desk

1253
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:06,680
but he receives the explorers in his study

1254
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,090
He asks them questions

1255
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,390
and he notes down what they recall of their travels

1256
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:17,180
and if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him

1257
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,540
The geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character

1258
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,520
Why is that

1259
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:32,640
Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer

1260
01:11:33,170 --> 01:11:36,960
so what an explorer who drank too much

1261
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,230
why is that

1262
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:41,090
asks the little prince

1263
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,340
Because intoxicated men see double

1264
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:50,380
then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only 1

1265
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,060
I know someone said the little prince

1266
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:56,640
who would make a bad explorer

1267
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,970
That is possible

1268
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,840
thenwhen the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good

1269
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,860
an inquiry as ordered into his discovery

1270
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:10,440
one goes to see it

1271
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,950
Nothat would be too complicated

1272
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:17,400
but one requires the explorer to furnish proofs

1273
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,540
for example

1274
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,940
if the discovery and question is that of a large mountain

1275
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:26,080
one requires that large stones be brought back from it

1276
01:12:27,070 --> 01:12:30,400
The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement

1277
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:33,710
But you come from far away

1278
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,490
you are an explorer

1279
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:38,350
you shall describe your planet to me

1280
01:12:39,010 --> 01:12:41,710
and having opened his big register

1281
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:44,460
the geographer sharpened his pencil

1282
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:48,320
The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil

1283
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:54,270
one waits until the explorer has furnished proofs before putting them down in ink

1284
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:58,050
Wellsaid the geographer expectantly

1285
01:12:58,580 --> 01:12:59,270
Oh

1286
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,560
where I live

1287
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,020
said the little prince

1288
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,170
it is not very interesting

1289
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,000
it is all so small

1290
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,890
I have three volcanoes

1291
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,160
two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct

1292
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:12,790
but one never knows

1293
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:14,810
one never knows

1294
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:16,300
said the geographer

1295
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,790
I have also a flower

1296
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,500
we do not record flowers

1297
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,900
said the geographer

1298
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:28,340
Why is that the flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet

1299
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:30,640
We do not record them

1300
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,880
said the geographer

1301
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,720
because they are etherol

1302
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:36,830
What does that mean

1303
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:39,820
Ephemeral geographies

1304
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,240
said the geographer

1305
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,960
are the books which of all books are most concerned with matters of consequence

1306
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,990
They never become old fashioned

1307
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,880
it is very rarely that a mountain changes its position

1308
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:58,060
It is very rarely that an ocean identities itself of its waters

1309
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:00,980
We write of eternal things

1310
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,110
but extinct volcanoes may come to life again

1311
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:06,980
The little prince interrupted

1312
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,440
What does that mean

1313
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,830
ephemeral

1314
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,010
Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive

1315
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:15,140
it comes to the same thing for us

1316
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,660
said the geographer

1317
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,940
the thing that matters to us is the mountain

1318
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,880
it does not change

1319
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:23,970
But what does that mean

1320
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,060
Ephemeralrepeated

1321
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:31,700
the little prince who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it

1322
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:36,660
it means which is in danger of speedy disappearance

1323
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:40,650
is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance

1324
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:42,660
Certainly it is

1325
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,700
my flower is ephemeral

1326
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:47,830
the little prince said to himself

1327
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:52,990
and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world

1328
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,090
and I have left her on my planet all alone

1329
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:00,710
That was his first moment of regret

1330
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,220
but he took courage once more

1331
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,300
What place would you advise me to visit now

1332
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,610
he asked

1333
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,120
The planet Earth

1334
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,940
replied the geographer

1335
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,080
it has a good reputation

1336
01:15:15,090 --> 01:15:18,970
and the little prince went away thinking of his flower

1337
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:28,800
16so then the seventh ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌planet was the Earth

1338
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:33,200
The Earth is not just an ordinary planet

1339
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:37,180
One can count there 111 kings

1340
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:38,720
not forgetting to be sure

1341
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:39,610
the Negro kings

1342
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:40,600
among them

1343
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,890
7000 geographers

1344
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,520
900000 businessmen

1345
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:49,240
7500000 tipplers

1346
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:52,160
311 million conceited men

1347
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,370
that is to say

1348
01:15:53,450 --> 01:15:55,950
about 2 billion grown ups

1349
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,440
To give you an idea of the size of the earth

1350
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:20,330
I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain over the whole of the six continents a veritable army of 462511 lamplighters for the street lamps seen from a slight distance that would make a splendid spectacle

1351
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:24,750
The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet

1352
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,720
In the opera

1353
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,820
First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia

1354
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:33,410
Having set their lamps light

1355
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,490
these would go off to sleep

1356
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,000
next the lamplighters of China

1357
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:41,240
and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance

1358
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:45,140
and then they too would be waved back into the wings

1359
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:50,680
After that​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies

1360
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:53,210
then those of Africa and Europe

1361
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,820
then those of South America

1362
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,010
then those of North America

1363
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:03,640
and never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage

1364
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,200
It would be magnificent

1365
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:15,150
only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole

1366
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,020
Only these two would live free from toil and care

1367
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:21,560
They would be busy twice a year

1368
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,740
17

1369
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,830
when one wishes to play the wit

1370
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:33,070
he sometimes wanders a little from the truth

1371
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:38,730
I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters

1372
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:45,070
and I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it

1373
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,760
Men occupy a very small place upon the earth

1374
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:57,530
If the 2 billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together

1375
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:00,200
as they do for some big public assembly

1376
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:07,430
they could easily be put into one public square 20 miles long and 20 miles wide

1377
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:13,140
All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet

1378
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,310
The grownups

1379
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,160
to be sure

1380
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,890
will not believe you when you tell them that

1381
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,620
They imagine that they fill a great deal of space

1382
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:27,280
They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs

1383
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,130
You should advise them then

1384
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,660
to make their own calculations

1385
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:33,770
They adore figures

1386
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:35,260
and that will please them

1387
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,790
but do not waste your time on this extra task

1388
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,340
It is unnecessary

1389
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,270
You have

1390
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,190
I know

1391
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,830
confidence in me

1392
01:18:44,530 --> 01:18:46,890
When the little prince arrived on the earth

1393
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:50,740
he was very much surprised not to see any people

1394
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:59,140
He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet when a coil of gold the color of the moonlight flashed across the sand

1395
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,980
Good evening

1396
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:03,360
said the little prince courteously

1397
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:05,670
Good evening

1398
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:07,950
said the snake

1399
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:11,520
what planet is this on which I have come down

1400
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,290
asked the little prince

1401
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,650
This is the earth

1402
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,840
this is Africa

1403
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:22,200
the snake answered

1404
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,250
Then there are no people on the earth

1405
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:29,420
this is the desert

1406
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,860
there are ​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌no people in the desert

1407
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,500
The earth is large

1408
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,070
said the snake

1409
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,280
The little prince sat down on a stone and raised his eyes toward the sky

1410
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,640
I wonder

1411
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,860
he said

1412
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:54,480
whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again

1413
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,620
Look at my planet

1414
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,410
It is right there above us

1415
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,760
but how far away it is

1416
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:04,030
it is beautiful

1417
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,360
the snake said

1418
01:20:06,850 --> 01:20:10,150
What has brought you here

1419
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,020
I have been having some trouble with a flower

1420
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:14,800
said the little prince

1421
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:17,810
Said the snake

1422
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:20,140
and they were both science

1423
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:23,420
Where are the men

1424
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,750
The little prince at last took up the conversation again

1425
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:29,840
It is a little lonely in the desert

1426
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:33,940
It is also lonely among men

1427
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,720
the snake said

1428
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:39,820
The little prince gazed at him for a long time

1429
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,810
You are a funny animal

1430
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,460
he said at last

1431
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,970
you are no thicker than a finger

1432
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:51,980
but I am more powerful than the finger of a king

1433
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:54,100
said the snake

1434
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,150
The little prince smiled

1435
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:59,180
You are not very powerful

1436
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,980
you haven't even any feet

1437
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:03,080
you cannot even travel

1438
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:08,460
I can carry you farther than any ship could take you

1439
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:10,350
said the snake

1440
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:14,940
He twined himself around the little prince's ankle like a golden bracelet

1441
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:22,610
Whomever I touch I send back to the earth from whence he came

1442
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,100
The snake spoke again

1443
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,450
but you are innocent and true

1444
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:32,100
and you come from a star

1445
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:36,940
The little prince made no reply

1446
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,070
You move me to pity

1447
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:45,390
You are so weak on this earth made of granite

1448
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,140
the snake said

1449
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:56,620
I can help you some day if you grow to homesick for your own planet

1450
01:21:59,250 --> 01:21:59,500
I can

1451
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,940
ohI understand you very well

1452
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:04,380
said the little prince

1453
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,020
but why do you always speak in riddles

1454
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,980
I solve them all

1455
01:22:11,190 --> 01:22:12,520
said the snake

1456
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,480
and they were both science

1457
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,410
18

1458
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:25,720
the little Prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower

1459
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:28,910
It was a flower with three petals

1460
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:31,470
a flower of no account at all

1461
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:33,520
Good morning

1462
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:35,020
said the little prince

1463
01:22:36,040 --> 01:22:37,160
Good morning

1464
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:38,520
said the flower

1465
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:40,280
Where are the men

1466
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:42,660
the little prince asked politely

1467
01:22:43,210 --> 01:22:46,160
The flower had once seen a caravan passing

1468
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,100
menshe echoed

1469
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:52,620
I think there are 6 or seven of them in existence

1470
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:55,280
I saw them several years ago

1471
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:58,060
but no one knows where to find them

1472
01:22:58,070 --> 01:22:59,790
The wind blows them away

1473
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:01,610
they have no roots

1474
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:04,340
and that makes their life very difficult

1475
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,240
Good bye

1476
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,720
said the little prince

1477
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:08,990
Good bye

1478
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:10,680
said the flower

1479
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:17,990
19 after that

1480
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,960
the little prince climbed a high mountain

1481
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:25,180
The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes

1482
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:27,040
which came up to his knees

1483
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:33,980
and he used the extinct volcano as a footstool from a mountain as high as this one

1484
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:35,740
He said to himself

1485
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,040
I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance

1486
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,030
and all the people

1487
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:48,180
But he saw nothing save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles

1488
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,410
Good morning

1489
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:52,310
he said courteously

1490
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:53,490
Good morning

1491
01:23:53,490 --> 01:23:54,430
good morning

1492
01:23:54,430 --> 01:23:55,050
good morning

1493
01:23:56,110 --> 01:23:57,460
answered the echo

1494
01:23:58,380 --> 01:23:59,860
Who are you

1495
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:01,280
said the little prince

1496
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,520
Who are you

1497
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:03,710
who are you

1498
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:06,860
who are you answered the echo

1499
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:08,580
Be my friends

1500
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,160
I am all alone

1501
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,230
he said

1502
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,810
I am all alone

1503
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:13,430
all alone

1504
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:17,060
Answered the echo

1505
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:20,100
What a queer planet

1506
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:21,120
he thought

1507
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,920
It is altogether dry

1508
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:27,100
and altogether pointed and altogether harsh and forbidding

1509
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,510
and the people have no imagination

1510
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:32,060
They repeat whatever one says to them

1511
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,670
On my planet I had a flower

1512
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,650
she always was the first to speak

1513
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,320
20

1514
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:49,320
but it happened that after walking for a long time through sand and rocks and snow

1515
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:52,620
the little prince at last came upon a road

1516
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:56,350
and all roads lead to the abodes of men

1517
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,440
Good morning

1518
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,940
he said

1519
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:02,100
He was standing before a garden

1520
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,340
all abloom with roses

1521
01:25:04,980 --> 01:25:06,420
Good morning

1522
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:07,980
said the roses

1523
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,220
The little prince gazed at them

1524
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:13,160
They all looked like his flower

1525
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:15,540
Who are you

1526
01:25:15,550 --> 01:25:16,220
he demanded

1527
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:16,920
thunderstruck

1528
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:19,590
We are roses

1529
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,200
the roses said

1530
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:24,050
and he was overcome with sadness

1531
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:30,040
His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe

1532
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:33,830
and here were 5000 of them

1533
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:35,230
all alike

1534
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,330
in one single garden

1535
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:40,670
She would be very much annoyed

1536
01:25:40,680 --> 01:25:42,370
he said to himself

1537
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:46,600
if she should see that she would cough most dreadfully

1538
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:50,840
and she would pretend that she was dying to avoid being laughed at

1539
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,660
and I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life

1540
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:58,100
For if I did not do that to humble myself also

1541
01:25:58,210 --> 01:26:00,620
she would really allow herself to die

1542
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:04,440
Then he went on with his reflections

1543
01:26:05,550 --> 01:26:10,520
I thought that I was rich with a flower that was unique in all the world

1544
01:26:10,620 --> 01:26:13,450
and all I had was a common rose

1545
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:15,490
a common rose

1546
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:18,480
and three volcanoes that come up to my knees

1547
01:26:18,650 --> 01:26:21,610
and one of them perhaps extinct forever

1548
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:24,920
That doesn't make me a very great prince

1549
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:29,240
And he lay down in the grass and cried

1550
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:33,960
21

1551
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:37,740
It was then that the fox appeared

1552
01:26:38,450 --> 01:26:39,550
Good morning

1553
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,700
said the fox

1554
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:42,400
Good morning

1555
01:26:42,570 --> 01:26:44,870
The little prince responded politely

1556
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,800
although when he turned around he saw nothing

1557
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,840
I am right here

1558
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:51,020
the voice said

1559
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,710
under the apple tree

1560
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:54,960
Who are you

1561
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,220
asked the little prince

1562
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:59,940
and added you are very pretty to look at

1563
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:02,380
I am a fox

1564
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:06,120
The fox said come and play with me

1565
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,840
proposed the little prince

1566
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:12,390
I am so unhappy I cannot play with you

1567
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,340
The fox said I am not tamed

1568
01:27:17,220 --> 01:27:18,670
Please excuse me

1569
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:19,970
said the little prince

1570
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,300
but after some thought he added

1571
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,480
what does that mean

1572
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:25,240
tame

1573
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:27,600
You do not live here

1574
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:28,940
said the fox

1575
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:30,980
what is it that you are looking for

1576
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,030
I am looking for men

1577
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,400
said the little prince

1578
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:36,280
What does that mean

1579
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:38,550
Tame men

1580
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,700
said the fox

1581
01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:41,640
They have guns and they hunt

1582
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,220
It is very disturbing

1583
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:44,810
they also raise chickens

1584
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:46,860
these are their only interests

1585
01:27:47,180 --> 01:27:48,490
Are you looking for chickens

1586
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:51,720
Nosaid the little prince

1587
01:27:52,120 --> 01:27:53,940
I am looking for friends

1588
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:55,430
what does that mean

1589
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:56,340
Tame

1590
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:58,940
It is an act too often neglected

1591
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:00,400
said the fox

1592
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:02,580
It means to establish ties

1593
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,500
to establish ties

1594
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,310
Just that

1595
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,360
said the fox

1596
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:08,960
To me

1597
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:13,510
you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like 100000 other little boys

1598
01:28:13,590 --> 01:28:15,180
and I have no need of you

1599
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:17,970
and you on your part have no need of me

1600
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:21,970
To you I am nothing more than a fox like 100000 other foxes

1601
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:23,610
But if you tame me

1602
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:25,400
then we shall need each other

1603
01:28:25,530 --> 01:28:28,430
To me you will be unique in all the world

1604
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,330
To you

1605
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:31,420
I shall be unique in all the world

1606
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:34,460
I am beginning to understand

1607
01:28:34,630 --> 01:28:35,800
said the little prince

1608
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:38,320
there is a flower

1609
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:39,690
I think

1610
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:41,560
that she has tamed me

1611
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,320
It is possible

1612
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:44,730
said the fox

1613
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:45,820
On the earth

1614
01:28:45,830 --> 01:28:48,000
1 sees all sorts of things

1615
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,510
Ohbut this is not on the earth

1616
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,170
said the little prince

1617
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:56,900
The fox seemed perplexed and very curious

1618
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,390
On another planet

1619
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:03,730
yesare there hunters on that planet

1620
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,740
Nothat is interesting

1621
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:09,020
are there chickens

1622
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:12,620
Nonothing is perfect

1623
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:13,930
sighed the fox

1624
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:16,070
then he came back to his idea

1625
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,550
My life is very monotonous

1626
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,840
the fox said

1627
01:29:20,890 --> 01:29:21,920
I hunt chickens

1628
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:23,150
men hunt me

1629
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:24,840
all the chickens are just alike

1630
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:26,480
and all the men are just alike

1631
01:29:26,490 --> 01:29:29,440
and in consequence I am a little bored

1632
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,450
But if you tame me

1633
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:34,540
it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life

1634
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:38,660
I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others

1635
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:41,890
Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground

1636
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:46,240
Yours will call me like music out of my burrow

1637
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:46,980
And then

1638
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,630
lookyou see the grain fields down yonder

1639
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:51,260
I do not eat bread

1640
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,040
wheat is of no use to me

1641
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:55,660
the wheat fields have nothing to say to me

1642
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,210
and that is sad

1643
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,960
but you have hair that is the color of gold

1644
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:03,180
Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me

1645
01:30:03,220 --> 01:30:03,900
The grain

1646
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,180
which is also golden

1647
01:30:05,180 --> 01:30:07,310
will bring me back the thought of you

1648
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:10,600
and I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat

1649
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:14,720
The fox gazed at the little prince for a long time

1650
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,770
please pay me

1651
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:22,310
he said I want to very much

1652
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:24,390
the little prince replied

1653
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:26,640
but I have not much time

1654
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:30,480
I have friends to discover and a great many things to understand

1655
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,530
One only understands the things that one tames

1656
01:30:34,780 --> 01:30:36,190
said the fox

1657
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,250
Men have no more time to understand anything

1658
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,900
they buy things already made at the shops

1659
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,590
but there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship

1660
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:48,180
and so men have no friends anymore

1661
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:49,940
If you want a friend

1662
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,220
tame me

1663
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:53,880
What must I do to tame you

1664
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:56,010
asked the little prince

1665
01:30:56,740 --> 01:30:59,400
You must be very patient

1666
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,040
replied the fox

1667
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:05,950
First you will sit down at a little distance from me like that in the grass

1668
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:08,660
I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye

1669
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,390
and you will say nothing

1670
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:12,970
Words are the source of misunderstandings

1671
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:16,680
But you will sit a lit​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌tle closer to me every day

1672
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:20,180
The next day the little prince came back

1673
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,840
It would have been better to come back at the same hour

1674
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:25,330
said the fox

1675
01:31:25,390 --> 01:31:26,870
Iffor example

1676
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,840
you come at 4 o'clock in the afternoon

1677
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:32,020
then at 3 o'clock I shall begin to be happy

1678
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:35,870
I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances

1679
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:40,220
At 4 o'clock I shall already be worrying and jumping about

1680
01:31:40,300 --> 01:31:42,610
I shall show you how happy I am

1681
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:44,880
but if you come at just any time

1682
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:48,450
I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you

1683
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,200
One must observe the proper rights

1684
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:55,210
What is a right asked the little prince

1685
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:59,170
Those also are actions too often neglected

1686
01:31:59,280 --> 01:31:59,800
said the

1687
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:03,320
They are what makes one different from other days

1688
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,310
one hour from other hours

1689
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,300
There is a right

1690
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:07,330
For example

1691
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:08,700
among my hunters

1692
01:32:08,810 --> 01:32:11,800
every Thursday they dance with the village girls

1693
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:14,540
so Thursday is a wonderful day for me

1694
01:32:14,810 --> 01:32:17,270
I can take a walk as far as the vineyards

1695
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:20,310
but if the hunters danced at just any time

1696
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:22,600
every day would be like every other day

1697
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:25,240
and I should never have any vacation at all

1698
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:28,580
So the little prince tamed the fox

1699
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,860
and when the hour of his departure drew near

1700
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,600
said the fox

1701
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:36,610
I shall cry

1702
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,250
It is your own fault

1703
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:40,570
said the little prince

1704
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:43,160
I never wished you any sort of harm

1705
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:45,240
but you wanted me to tame you

1706
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:48,200
Yesthat is so

1707
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,770
said the fox

1708
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,550
But now you are going to cry

1709
01:32:52,770 --> 01:32:54,200
said the little prince

1710
01:32:54,630 --> 01:32:57,240
Yesthat is so

1711
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:58,740
said the fox

1712
01:32:58,950 --> 01:33:01,860
Then it has done you no good at all

1713
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:04,140
It has done me good

1714
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,620
said the fox

1715
01:33:05,630 --> 01:33:08,060
because of the color of the wheat fields

1716
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:10,080
and then he added

1717
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:13,010
go and look again at the roses

1718
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:16,650
You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world

1719
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:21,450
Then come back to say goodbye to me and I will make you a present of a secret

1720
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:25,960
The little prince went away to look again at the roses

1721
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:29,550
You are not at all like my rose

1722
01:33:29,590 --> 01:33:30,560
he said

1723
01:33:30,650 --> 01:33:32,480
As yet you are nothing

1724
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:36,260
no one has tamed you and you have tamed no one

1725
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,850
You are like my fox

1726
01:33:37,850 --> 01:33:39,240
When I first knew him

1727
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:40,670
he was only a fox

1728
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:43,020
like 100000 other foxes

1729
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:48,650
But I have made him my friend and now he is unique in all the world

1730
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:52,920
And the roses were very much embarrassed

1731
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,550
You are beautiful

1732
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,020
but you are empty

1733
01:33:57,150 --> 01:33:58,180
he went on

1734
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:01,340
One could not die for you to be sure

1735
01:34:01,530 --> 01:34:05,780
an ordinary passer by would think that my rose looked just like you

1736
01:34:06,290 --> 01:34:08,700
the rose that belongs to me

1737
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:14,580
But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses

1738
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:16,890
because it is she that I have watered

1739
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:20,590
because it is she that I have put under the glass globe

1740
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:24,210
because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen

1741
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:28,360
because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars

1742
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:32,240
except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies

1743
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:37,950
because it is she that I have listened to when she grumbled or boasted

1744
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:40,700
or even sometimes when she said nothing

1745
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:50,620
because she is my rose and he went back to meet the fox goodbye he said goodbye

1746
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,010
said the fox

1747
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:54,200
and now here is my secret

1748
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,310
a very simple secret

1749
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:57,860
It is only with the heart

1750
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:59,500
that one can see rightly

1751
01:34:59,550 --> 01:35:02,970
what is essential is invisible to the eye

1752
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:06,800
what is essential is invisible to the eye

1753
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,590
the little prince repeated so that he would be sure to remember

1754
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,120
it is the time you have wasted for your rose

1755
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,310
that makes your rose

1756
01:35:15,330 --> 01:35:16,460
so important

1757
01:35:17,270 --> 01:35:20,850
it is the time I have wasted for my rose

1758
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,560
said the little prince

1759
01:35:22,570 --> 01:35:28,360
so that he would be sure to remember men have forgotten this truth

1760
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:30,120
said the fox

1761
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:32,460
but you must not forget it

1762
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:40,150
you become responsible forever for what you have tamed you are responsible for your rose

1763
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:44,430
I am responsible for my rose

1764
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:46,390
the little prince repeated

1765
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,810
so that he would be sure to remember

1766
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,520
22

1767
01:35:55,730 --> 01:35:56,520
Good morning

1768
01:35:57,070 --> 01:35:58,490
said the little prince

1769
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,700
Good morning

1770
01:36:00,010 --> 01:36:01,600
said the railway switchman

1771
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,740
What do you do here

1772
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:05,490
the little prince asked

1773
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:08,390
I sort out travellers in bundles of 1000

1774
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:09,920
said the switched man

1775
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:12,850
I send off the trains and carry them now to the right

1776
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,340
now to the left

1777
01:36:14,480 --> 01:36:21,960
and a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder

1778
01:36:22,690 --> 01:36:24,560
They are in a great hurry

1779
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,070
said the little prince

1780
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,800
What are they looking for

1781
01:36:28,540 --> 01:36:30,920
Not even the locomotive engineer knows that

1782
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,280
said the switchman

1783
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:37,470
and a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by in the opposite direction

1784
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,660
Are they coming back already demanded the little prince

1785
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:43,760
These are not the same ones

1786
01:36:43,930 --> 01:36:44,890
said the switchman

1787
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,540
It is an exchange

1788
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:49,350
Were they not satisfied where they were

1789
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,440
asked the little prince

1790
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:53,940
No one is ever satisfied where he is

1791
01:36:53,970 --> 01:36:55,440
said the switchman

1792
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:59,950
and they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express

1793
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,220
Are they pursuing

1794
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:05,580
The first Travelers demanded the little prince

1795
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:07,580
They are pursuing nothing at all

1796
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:08,560
said the switchman

1797
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:10,130
they are asleep in there

1798
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:11,210
or if they are not asleep

1799
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:12,050
they are yawning

1800
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:15,240
Only the children are flattening their noses against the window panes

1801
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:19,620
Only the children know what they are looking for

1802
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:20,930
said the little prince

1803
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:24,190
They waste their time over a rag doll

1804
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:26,700
and it becomes very important to them

1805
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:29,210
and if anybody takes it away from them

1806
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:30,430
they cry

1807
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:32,640
They are lucky

1808
01:37:32,890 --> 01:37:34,410
this witch man said

1809
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,420
23

1810
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:41,700
Good morning

1811
01:37:41,850 --> 01:37:43,270
said the little prince

1812
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,780
Good morning

1813
01:37:44,850 --> 01:37:46,070
said the merchant

1814
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:51,240
This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to queries Thirst

1815
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:57,690
You need only swallow one pill a week and you would feel no need of anything to drink

1816
01:37:58,610 --> 01:37:59,940
Why are you selling though

1817
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:02,170
asked the little prince

1818
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:05,720
Because they save a tremendous amount of time

1819
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:07,040
said the merchant

1820
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:11,200
computations have been made by experts with these pills

1821
01:38:11,210 --> 01:38:14,690
You say 53 minutes in every week

1822
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,540
And what do I do with those 53 minutes

1823
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,110
Anything you like

1824
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,070
As for me

1825
01:38:22,290 --> 01:38:24,450
said the little prince to himself

1826
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:28,090
if I had 53 minutes to spend as I liked

1827
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:32,800
I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water

1828
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:37,930
24

1829
01:38:38,930 --> 01:38:43,340
It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert

1830
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:51,040
and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply

1831
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,220
I said to the little prince

1832
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,630
these memories of yours are very charming

1833
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,920
but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane

1834
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,260
I have nothing more to drink

1835
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:10,050
and I too should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water

1836
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,790
My friend the fox

1837
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:14,840
the little prince said to me

1838
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:16,750
my dear little man

1839
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:20,480
this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox

1840
01:39:21,110 --> 01:39:26,820
why not because I am about to die of thirst

1841
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:31,170
He did not follow my reasoning and he answered me

1842
01:39:31,610 --> 01:39:33,910
It is a good thing to have had a friend

1843
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,900
even if one is about to die

1844
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:37,590
Ifor instance

1845
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,800
am very glad to have had a fox as a friend

1846
01:39:42,050 --> 01:39:44,690
he has no way of guessing the danger

1847
01:39:44,830 --> 01:39:46,400
I said to myself

1848
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:49,680
he has never been either hungry or thirsty

1849
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:52,250
A little sunshine is all he needs

1850
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,680
but he looked at me steadily and replied to my thought

1851
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:01,610
I am thirsty to let us look for a well

1852
01:40:02,630 --> 01:40:05,290
I made a gesture of weariness

1853
01:40:05,660 --> 01:40:11,040
it is absurd to look for a well at random in the immensity of the desert

1854
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:18,920
but nevertheless we started walking when we had trudged along for several hours in silence

1855
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:22,730
the darkness fell and the stars began to come out

1856
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,490
Thirst had made me a little feverish

1857
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,020
and I looked at them as if I were in a dream

1858
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:32,730
The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory

1859
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,840
then You are thirsty too

1860
01:40:36,220 --> 01:40:37,440
I demanded

1861
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:40,000
but he did not reply to my question

1862
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,200
he merely said to me

1863
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:45,650
water may also be good for the heart

1864
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:48,790
I did not understand this answer

1865
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,150
but I said nothing

1866
01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:54,580
I knew very well that it was impossible to cross examine him

1867
01:40:55,630 --> 01:40:57,100
he was tired

1868
01:40:57,110 --> 01:40:58,340
he sat down

1869
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:00,860
I sat down beside him

1870
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:04,040
and after a little silence he spoke again

1871
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:10,090
The stars are beautiful because of a flower that cannot be seen

1872
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,530
I replied yes

1873
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:15,040
that is so

1874
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:17,480
And without saying anything more

1875
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:22,440
I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight

1876
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,240
The desert is beautiful

1877
01:41:25,420 --> 01:41:27,200
the little prince added

1878
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:28,760
and that was true

1879
01:41:29,180 --> 01:41:31,860
I have always loved the desert

1880
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:34,700
One sits down on a desert sand dune

1881
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:36,000
sees nothing

1882
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,600
here's nothing

1883
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:42,880
yet through the silence something throbs and gleams

1884
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,400
what makes the desert beautiful

1885
01:41:46,410 --> 01:41:47,780
said the little prince

1886
01:41:48,140 --> 01:41:51,250
is that somewhere it hides a well

1887
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:58,940
I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands

1888
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,010
When I was a little boy

1889
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:03,010
I lived in an old house

1890
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:10,780
and legend told us that a treasure was buried there to be sure no one had ever known how to find it

1891
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:13,710
perhaps no one had ever even looked for it

1892
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,330
but it cast an enchantment over that house

1893
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:22,080
My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart

1894
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:26,060
YesI said to the little prince

1895
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:27,730
the house

1896
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:29,000
the stars

1897
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,140
the desert

1898
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:34,050
what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible

1899
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,170
I am glad

1900
01:42:36,180 --> 01:42:42,350
he said that you agree with my fox as the little prince dropped off to sleep

1901
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:46,120
I took him in my arms and set out walking once more

1902
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:49,780
I felt deeply moved and stirred

1903
01:42:49,970 --> 01:42:54,800
It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure

1904
01:42:55,460 --> 01:43:02,740
It seemed to me even that there was nothing more fragile on all earth in the moonlight

1905
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:05,140
I looked at his pale forehead

1906
01:43:05,150 --> 01:43:06,700
his closed eyes

1907
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:09,560
his locks of hair that trembled in the wind

1908
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:11,450
and I said to myself

1909
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,500
what I see here is nothing but a shell

1910
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,100
What is most important is invisible

1911
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:24,490
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half smile

1912
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:26,330
I said to myself again

1913
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:33,540
what moves me so deeply about this little prince who is sleeping here is his loyalty to a flower

1914
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:40,210
the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp even when he is asleep

1915
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:44,040
And I felt him to be more fragile still

1916
01:43:44,820 --> 01:43:47,530
I felt the need of protecting him

1917
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:59,340
as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind and as I walked on so I found the well at daybreak

1918
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:11,680
25 men said the little prince set out on their way in express trains

1919
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:14,140
but they do not know what they are looking for

1920
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:18,680
Then they rush about and get excited and turn round and round

1921
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:20,220
And he added

1922
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,820
it is not worth the trouble

1923
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:28,250
The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara

1924
01:44:28,650 --> 01:44:32,270
The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand

1925
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:35,840
This one was like a well in a village

1926
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,250
but there was no village here

1927
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:40,660
and I thought I must be dreaming

1928
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,190
It is strange

1929
01:44:43,290 --> 01:44:44,820
I said to the little prince

1930
01:44:45,120 --> 01:44:46,740
everything is ready for use

1931
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:47,550
The pulley

1932
01:44:47,550 --> 01:44:48,190
the bucket

1933
01:44:48,190 --> 01:44:48,950
the rope

1934
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,610
He laughed

1935
01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:53,670
touched the rope and set the pulley to working

1936
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:59,540
And the pulley moaned like an old weather vane which the wind has long since forgotten

1937
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:01,970
Do you hear

1938
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,330
said the little prince

1939
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:05,740
We have wakened the well

1940
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:07,660
and it is singing

1941
01:45:08,580 --> 01:45:11,690
I did not want him to tire himself with the rope

1942
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:13,050
leave it to me

1943
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:13,780
I said

1944
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,460
it is too heavy for you

1945
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:20,080
I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there

1946
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:24,120
Happytired as I was over my achievement

1947
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:31,560
the song of the pulley was still in my ears and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water

1948
01:45:32,640 --> 01:45:35,290
I am thirsty for this water

1949
01:45:35,310 --> 01:45:36,560
said the little prince

1950
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:38,730
give me some of it to drink

1951
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:42,590
and I understood what he had been looking for

1952
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,420
I raised the bucket to his lips

1953
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:46,450
he drank

1954
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:47,940
his eyes closed

1955
01:45:48,210 --> 01:45:51,710
It was as sweet as some special festival treat

1956
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:56,060
This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment

1957
01:45:56,580 --> 01:45:59,950
its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars

1958
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,900
the song of the pulley

1959
01:46:01,960 --> 01:46:03,670
the effort of my arms

1960
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:05,910
It was good for the heart

1961
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:09,540
like a present When I was a little boy

1962
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,470
the lights of the Christmas tree

1963
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:13,620
the music of the midnight mass

1964
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:17,800
the tenderness of smiling faces used to make up

1965
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:20,570
so the radiance of the gifts I received

1966
01:46:21,710 --> 01:46:23,260
The men where you live

1967
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:28,260
said the little prince raise 5000 roses in the same garden

1968
01:46:28,450 --> 01:46:33,850
and they do not find in it what they are looking for They do not find it

1969
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,100
I replied

1970
01:46:35,620 --> 01:46:41,420
and yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose or in a little water

1971
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,240
Yesthat is true

1972
01:46:44,570 --> 01:46:45,620
I said

1973
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,820
and the little prince added

1974
01:46:48,520 --> 01:46:50,410
but the eyes are blind

1975
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:52,220
One must look with the heart

1976
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,130
I had drunk the water

1977
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:58,680
I breathed easily at sunrise

1978
01:46:58,690 --> 01:47:00,980
the sand is the color of honey

1979
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,880
and that honey color was making me happy too

1980
01:47:04,850 --> 01:47:06,200
What brought me then

1981
01:47:06,210 --> 01:47:07,710
this sense of grief

1982
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:11,170
You must keep your promise

1983
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:15,220
said the little prince softly as he sat down beside me once more

1984
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,390
What promise

1985
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:18,340
you know

1986
01:47:18,660 --> 01:47:20,480
a muzzle for my sheep

1987
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:22,970
I am responsible for this flower

1988
01:47:24,780 --> 01:47:28,080
I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket

1989
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:33,390
the little prince looked them over and laughed as he said your bow Babs

1990
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:35,860
they look a little like cabbages

1991
01:47:36,140 --> 01:47:39,990
OhI had been so proud of my bow Babs

1992
01:47:40,730 --> 01:47:41,920
your fox

1993
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:47,270
his ears look a little like horns and they are too long and he laughed again

1994
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:50,620
You are not fair little prince

1995
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:51,760
I said

1996
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:58,470
I don't know how to draw anything except boa constructors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside

1997
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,340
Ohthat will be all right

1998
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:02,290
he said

1999
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,880
Children understand

2000
01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:08,680
So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle and as I gave it to him

2001
01:48:08,700 --> 01:48:10,440
my heart was torn

2002
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,110
You have plans that I do not know about

2003
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:14,860
I said

2004
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,260
but he did not answer me

2005
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:19,240
he said to me instead

2006
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:22,890
you know my descent to the earth

2007
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:26,060
tomorrow will be its anniversary

2008
01:48:26,500 --> 01:48:28,150
Thenafter a silence

2009
01:48:28,150 --> 01:48:29,090
he went on

2010
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:33,880
I came down very near here and he flushed

2011
01:48:34,230 --> 01:48:35,270
and once again

2012
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:37,000
without understanding why

2013
01:48:37,190 --> 01:48:39,390
I had a queer sense of sorrow

2014
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:40,820
One question

2015
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:43,470
howeveroccurred to me then

2016
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:47,740
It was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you a week ago

2017
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:49,770
you were strolling along like that

2018
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:50,860
all alone

2019
01:48:50,870 --> 01:48:53,950
1000 miles from any inhabited region

2020
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:57,780
You are on your way back to the place where you landed

2021
01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:00,660
The little prince flushed again

2022
01:49:01,190 --> 01:49:03,780
and I added with some hesitancy

2023
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:07,470
Perhaps it was because of the anniversary

2024
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,620
the little prince flushed once more

2025
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:12,980
He had never answered questions

2026
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:16,950
but when one flushes does that not mean yes

2027
01:49:19,030 --> 01:49:20,290
I said to him

2028
01:49:20,590 --> 01:49:22,100
I am a little frightened

2029
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:24,100
but he interrupted me

2030
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:25,700
Now you must work

2031
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:27,620
You must return to your engine

2032
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:29,340
I will be waiting for you here

2033
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:31,340
come back tomorrow evening

2034
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:33,920
but I was not reassured

2035
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:41,280
I remembered the Fox 1 runs the risk of weeping a little if 1 let's himself be tamed

2036
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,740
26

2037
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall

2038
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:55,020
When I came back for my work the next evening

2039
01:49:55,060 --> 01:50:01,590
I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall with his feet dangling

2040
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:03,960
And I heard him say

2041
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:06,020
then you don't remember

2042
01:50:06,030 --> 01:50:07,840
this is not the exact spot

2043
01:50:09,230 --> 01:50:11,470
Another voice must have answered him for

2044
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:12,690
He replied to it

2045
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:14,110
Yesyes

2046
01:50:14,120 --> 01:50:15,480
it is the right day

2047
01:50:15,490 --> 01:50:17,300
but this is not the place

2048
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:20,820
I continued my walk toward the wall

2049
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,930
At no time did I see or hear anyone

2050
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,410
The little prince

2051
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:27,480
howeverreplied once again

2052
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:31,520
exactlyyou will see where my track begins in the sand

2053
01:50:31,570 --> 01:50:34,070
you have nothing to do but wait for me there

2054
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:35,690
I shall be there tonight

2055
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:40,890
I was only 20 m from the wall and I still saw nothing

2056
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:42,280
After a silence

2057
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:44,050
the little prince spoke again

2058
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:46,540
You have good poison

2059
01:50:46,700 --> 01:50:49,970
you are sure that it will not make me suffer too long

2060
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:52,350
I stopped in my tracks

2061
01:50:52,360 --> 01:50:54,080
my heart torn asunder

2062
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:56,740
but still I did not understand

2063
01:50:57,480 --> 01:50:58,840
Now go away

2064
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:00,090
said the little prince

2065
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:02,360
I want to get down from the wall

2066
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:06,080
I dropped my eyes then to the foot of the wall

2067
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:08,140
and I leaped into the air

2068
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,510
There before me

2069
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,080
facing the little prince

2070
01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:16,360
was one of those yellow snakes that take just 30 seconds to bring your life to an end

2071
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:20,470
Even as I was digging into my pocket to get out my revolver

2072
01:51:20,550 --> 01:51:22,480
I made a running step back

2073
01:51:22,690 --> 01:51:23,980
but at the noise I made

2074
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,760
the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain

2075
01:51:29,070 --> 01:51:31,460
and in no apparent hurry

2076
01:51:31,470 --> 01:51:35,400
disappeared with a light metallic sound among the stones

2077
01:51:36,370 --> 01:51:40,030
I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms

2078
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:42,300
His face was white as snow

2079
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:44,420
What does this mean

2080
01:51:44,430 --> 01:51:45,170
I demanded

2081
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:47,200
Why are you talking with snakes

2082
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:51,150
I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore

2083
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:54,710
I had moistened his temples and had given him some water to drink

2084
01:51:55,150 --> 01:51:58,850
and now I did not dare ask him any more questions

2085
01:51:59,300 --> 01:52:03,780
He looked at me very gravely and put his arms around my neck

2086
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:09,380
I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird shot with someone's rifle

2087
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:13,900
I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine

2088
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:15,160
he said

2089
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:17,100
Now you can go back home

2090
01:52:17,660 --> 01:52:19,400
How did you know about that

2091
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:26,710
I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful beyond anything that I had dared to hope

2092
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,180
He made no answer to my question

2093
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:35,420
but he added I too am going back home to then

2094
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:36,550
Sadly

2095
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:39,420
it is much farther

2096
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:41,610
It is much more difficult

2097
01:52:42,650 --> 01:52:46,660
I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening

2098
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:51,540
I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child

2099
01:52:51,780 --> 01:52:59,750
and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him

2100
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:02,540
His look was very serious

2101
01:53:02,610 --> 01:53:04,960
like some one lost far away

2102
01:53:05,650 --> 01:53:07,060
I have your sheep

2103
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:09,620
and I have the sheep's box

2104
01:53:09,660 --> 01:53:11,360
and I have the muzzle

2105
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,660
and he gave me a sad smile

2106
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:19,140
I waited a long time

2107
01:53:19,770 --> 01:53:22,780
I could see that he was reviving little by little

2108
01:53:23,610 --> 01:53:25,160
dear little man

2109
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:26,380
I said to him

2110
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,140
you are afraid

2111
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:30,120
He was afraid

2112
01:53:30,130 --> 01:53:31,910
there was no doubt about that

2113
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:33,960
but he laughed lightly

2114
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:37,450
I shall be much more afraid this evening

2115
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:44,460
Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable

2116
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:50,440
and I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter anymore

2117
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,710
For me it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert

2118
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,780
Little man

2119
01:53:57,810 --> 01:53:59,020
I said

2120
01:53:59,210 --> 01:54:01,480
I want to hear you laugh again

2121
01:54:02,190 --> 01:54:05,230
But he said to me tonight

2122
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,830
it will be a year

2123
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:13,950
My star then can be found right above the place where I came to the earth a year ago

2124
01:54:15,070 --> 01:54:16,160
Little man

2125
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:17,320
I said

2126
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:20,040
tell me that is only a bad dream

2127
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:23,820
this affair of the snake and the meeting place and the star

2128
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:26,900
But he did not answer my plea

2129
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:30,500
He said to me instead

2130
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:35,360
the thing that is important is the thing that is not seen

2131
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,040
Yes

2132
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:40,560
I know it is just as it is with the flower

2133
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:43,900
If you love a flower that lives on a star

2134
01:54:44,130 --> 01:54:46,600
it is sweet to look at the sky at night

2135
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:50,100
all the stars are abloom with flowers

2136
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:52,380
YesI know

2137
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:58,540
it is just as it is with the water becau​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌​​​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​‌‌‌‌​‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌‌‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌‌‌​​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​‌‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌se of the pulley and the rope

2138
01:54:58,650 --> 01:55:01,560
What you gave me to drink was like music

2139
01:55:01,860 --> 01:55:04,290
you remember how good it was

2140
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:06,000
YesI know

2141
01:55:06,270 --> 01:55:10,890
and at night you will look up at the stars where I live

2142
01:55:10,930 --> 01:55:16,100

2143
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,750
It is better like that

2144
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:27,550
My star will just be one of the stars for you and so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens

2145
01:55:27,960 --> 01:55:33,180
they will all be your friends and besides I'm going to make you a present

2146
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:35,330
He laughed again

2147
01:55:36,630 --> 01:55:37,530
Little prince

2148
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:39,060
dear little prince

2149
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:41,360
I love to hear that laughter

2150
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:44,110
that is my present

2151
01:55:44,660 --> 01:55:49,040
just that it will be as it was when we drank the water

2152
01:55:50,230 --> 01:55:51,880
What are you trying to say

2153
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:55,890
All men have the stars

2154
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:57,220
he answered

2155
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:00,840
but they are not the same things for different people

2156
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,610
For some who are travelers

2157
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:06,400
the stars are guides

2158
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,990
for others there are no more than little lights in the sky

2159
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:13,880
for others who are scholars

2160
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:15,470
they are problems

2161
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:17,450
For my business man

2162
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:18,680
they were wealth

2163
01:56:18,780 --> 01:56:21,948
but all these stars are science

2164
01:56:21,948 --> 01:56:27,580
You alone will have the stars as no one else has them

2165
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:33,660
What are you trying to say in one of the stars

2166
01:56:33,790 --> 01:56:36,840
I shall be living in one of them

2167
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:38,500
I shall be laughing

2168
01:56:39,050 --> 01:56:42,760
and so it will be as if all the stars were laughing

2169
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:45,340
When you look at the sky at night

2170
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:51,290
you only you will have stars that can laugh

2171
01:56:52,450 --> 01:56:54,010
And he laughed again

2172
01:56:55,320 --> 01:56:58,000
and when your sorrow is comforted

2173
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:00,400
time soothed all sorrows

2174
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:03,600
you will be content that you have known me

2175
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:05,790
you will always be my friend

2176
01:57:06,120 --> 01:57:08,310
you will want to laugh with me

2177
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:11,390
and you will sometimes open your window

2178
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:13,020
so for that pleasure

2179
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:19,000
and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky

2180
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:20,980
Then you will say to them

2181
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:25,130
yesthe stars always make me laugh

2182
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:27,940
and they will think you are crazy

2183
01:57:28,080 --> 01:57:32,220
It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you

2184
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:35,360
and he laughed again

2185
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:39,290
it will be as if in place of the stars

2186
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:44,130
I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh

2187
01:57:45,030 --> 01:57:46,780
and he laughed again

2188
01:57:47,680 --> 01:57:49,880
Then he quickly became serious

2189
01:57:51,020 --> 01:57:51,800
Tonight

2190
01:57:51,820 --> 01:57:52,950
you know

2191
01:57:53,290 --> 01:57:54,660
do not come

2192
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:56,800
I shall not leave you

2193
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:58,320
I said

2194
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:01,410
I shall look as if I were suffering

2195
01:58:01,740 --> 01:58:04,220
I shall look a little as if I were dying

2196
01:58:04,730 --> 01:58:06,030
It is like that

2197
01:58:06,440 --> 01:58:10,290
do not come to see that it is not worth the trouble

2198
01:58:10,640 --> 01:58:12,620
I shall not leave you

2199
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:15,130
But he was worried

2200
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,610
I tell you it is also because of the snake

2201
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,720
he must not bite you snakes

2202
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:25,000
they are malicious creatures

2203
01:58:25,030 --> 01:58:27,470
this one might bite you just for fun

2204
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:31,110
I shall not leave you

2205
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:33,900
but a thought came to reassure him

2206
01:58:34,850 --> 01:58:43,590
it is true that they have no more poison for a second bite that night I did not see him set out on his way

2207
01:58:43,890 --> 01:58:52,630
he got away from me without making a sound when I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step

2208
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:58,840
he said to me merely you are there and he took me by the hand

2209
01:58:59,210 --> 01:59:03,920
but he was still worrying it was wrong of you to come

2210
01:59:03,980 --> 01:59:05,390
you will suffer

2211
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:07,400
I shall look as if I were dead

2212
01:59:07,690 --> 01:59:09,420
and that will not be true

2213
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:11,660
I said nothing

2214
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:16,410
You understand it is too far

2215
01:59:16,420 --> 01:59:18,900
I cannot carry this body with me

2216
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:20,410
It is too heavy

2217
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,160
I said nothing

2218
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:27,200
but it will be like an old abandoned shell

2219
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,570
There is nothing sad about old shells

2220
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:33,410
I said nothing

2221
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:36,090
He was a little discouraged

2222
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,060
but he made one more effort

2223
01:59:38,920 --> 01:59:41,870
You know it will be very nice

2224
01:59:42,240 --> 01:59:44,710
I too shall look at the stars

2225
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:48,440
All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley

2226
01:59:48,580 --> 01:59:52,790
All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink

2227
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:55,100
I said nothing

2228
01:59:56,480 --> 01:59:58,430
that will be so amusing

2229
01:59:58,480 --> 02:00:06,030
You will have 500 million little bells and I shall have 500 million springs of fresh water

2230
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:11,670
and he too said nothing more because he was crying

2231
02:00:12,640 --> 02:00:13,820
Here it is

2232
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:16,080
let me go on by myself

2233
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:20,100
And he sat down because he was afraid

2234
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,530
Then he said again

2235
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,290
you know

2236
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:25,600
my flower

2237
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:30,220
I am responsible for her and she is so weak

2238
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:32,080
she is so naive

2239
02:00:32,180 --> 02:00:38,390
She has four thorns of no use at all to protect herself against all the world

2240
02:00:39,670 --> 02:00:47,220
I too sat down because I was not able to stand up any longer there

2241
02:00:47,490 --> 02:00:49,320
Now that is all

2242
02:00:50,340 --> 02:00:52,250
He still hesitated a little

2243
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:53,320
then he got up

2244
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,070
he took one step

2245
02:00:55,370 --> 02:00:56,890
I could not move

2246
02:00:57,790 --> 02:01:01,420
there was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle

2247
02:01:01,940 --> 02:01:04,220
He remained motionless for an instant

2248
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:06,320
he did not cry out

2249
02:01:06,730 --> 02:01:09,870
he fell as gently as a tree falls

2250
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:13,840
there was not even any sound because of the sand

2251
02:01:18,560 --> 02:01:25,040
27 and now six years have already gone by

2252
02:01:25,510 --> 02:01:28,130
I have never yet told this story

2253
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:33,280
The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive

2254
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:35,080
I was sad

2255
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:38,350
but I told them I am tired

2256
02:01:39,220 --> 02:01:42,180
Now my sorrow is comforted a little

2257
02:01:42,540 --> 02:01:43,710
that is to say

2258
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:45,520
not entirely

2259
02:01:46,140 --> 02:01:52,090
but I know that he did go back to his planet because I did not find his body at daybreak

2260
02:01:52,510 --> 02:01:54,620
It was not such a heavy body

2261
02:01:55,140 --> 02:01:57,940
and at night I loved to listen to the stars

2262
02:01:58,310 --> 02:02:02,820
It is like 500 million little bells

2263
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:10,080
but there is one extraordinary thing when I drew the muzzle for the little prince

2264
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:13,530
I forgot to add the leather strap to it

2265
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:17,550
He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep

2266
02:02:18,220 --> 02:02:22,600
So now I keep wondering what is happening on his planet

2267
02:02:22,900 --> 02:02:27,100
Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower at one time

2268
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:28,270
I say to myself

2269
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:29,440
surely not

2270
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:36,020
the little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night and he watches over his sheep very carefully

2271
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:38,650
then I am happy

2272
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:43,000
and there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars

2273
02:02:43,720 --> 02:02:46,480
But at another time I say to myself

2274
02:02:46,950 --> 02:02:50,310
at some moment or other one is absent minded

2275
02:02:50,370 --> 02:02:51,850
and that is enough

2276
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:55,300
On some one evening he forgot the glass globe

2277
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:58,560
or the sheep got out without making any noise in the night

2278
02:02:59,650 --> 02:03:02,520
and then the little bells are changed to tears

2279
02:03:03,430 --> 02:03:03,860
Here

2280
02:03:03,860 --> 02:03:07,520
thenis a great mystery for you

2281
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:09,590
who also love the little prince

2282
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,620
and for me

2283
02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:22,780
nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere we do not know where a sheep that we never saw has yes or no Eaton arose

2284
02:03:25,120 --> 02:03:26,720
Look up at the sky

2285
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,470
Ask yourselves

2286
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:30,800
is it yes or no

2287
02:03:31,180 --> 02:03:33,460
Has the sheep eaten the flour

2288
02:03:34,010 --> 02:03:36,930
And you will see how everything changes

2289
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:44,040
And no grownup will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance

2290
02:03:44,510 --> 02:03:45,880
This is to me

2291
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:49,680
the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world

2292
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:53,440
It is the same as that on the preceding page

2293
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:57,190
but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory

2294
02:03:57,670 --> 02:04:02,290
It is here that the little Prince appeared on earth and disappeared

2295
02:04:02,730 --> 02:04:10,480
Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you travel someday to the African desert

2296
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:13,620
and if you should come upon this spot

2297
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:16,010
please do not hurry on

2298
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:20,400
Wait for a time exactly under the star

2299
02:04:22,120 --> 02:04:25,220
Thenif a little man appears who laughs

2300
02:04:25,330 --> 02:04:26,980
who has golden hair

2301
02:04:27,010 --> 02:04:29,270
and who refuses to answer questions

2302
02:04:29,540 --> 02:04:31,400
you will know who he is

2303
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:33,310
If this should happen

2304
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:35,010
please comfort me

2305
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:38,440
send me word that he has come back

2306
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:51,260
